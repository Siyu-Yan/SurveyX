INTRODUCTION\nThe Hopfield model [1] is one of the simplest mathematical models which explains associative memory. This model is characterized by binary state neurons and each neuron is represented by Ising spin. In this model system, arbitrary two neurons are interacted each other via so called Hebb rule. The Hebb rule is one of the standard learning rules of the patterns \u03be\u00b5 i (i = 1, . . . , N; \u00b5 = 1, . . . , p) and determines the strength of the interaction Jij between the i and j-th neurons, say, Si and Sj, as\nwhere \u00b5 means the number of embedded patterns and N denotes the number of neurons. These features have been investigated by statistical mechanics deeply [2, 3]. Actually, up to now, various extensions and generalizations of the Hopfield model were proposed and these properties were investigated from statistical mechanical point of view (see, for example [3]). However, little is known about the properties of the Hopfield model in which the length of interactions Jij is restricted to the nearest neighboring neurons. By the analogy to the spin system in statistical mechanics, we call this type of the Hopfield model finite-dimensional Hopfield model. Inspired by the study of Nishimori, Whyte and Sherrington [4], in this paper, we consider the finite-dimensional Hopfield model storing structured patterns. In general, it is hard to analyze such finite-dimensional systems explicitly. However, one can derive several rigorous results of thermodynamic properties of the system by assistant of the Pierls arguments and the gauge transformations [4]. Although the qualitative features of the phase diagrams of the system became clear by these analyses, nobody yet succeeded in deriving their quantitative behavior at all. In this paper, we analyze the storage capacity of the system quantitatively. We restrict ourselves to the case of two-dimensional system on the square lattice. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we explain our model system. In Sec. III, we briefly review the qualitative features of the phase diagram obtained by Nishimori et al [4]. In Sec. IV, we analyze the storage capacity of our model system. Section V is devoted to discussion of all results we obtain.\n(1)\nIn this section, we define our model systems. The Hamiltonian of the system is given \nwhere Si(i = 1, . . . , N) are the states of the neuron taking binary value \u00b11, and Jij is the strength of the interaction between Si and Sj. The summation \ufffd \u27e8ij\u27e9appearing in Eq. (2) runs over nearest neighboring neurons on a square lattice. We chose the short range Hebb rule as a interaction which is given by\nfor the nearest neighboring sites \u27e8ij\u27e9and Jij = 0 otherwise. Here, p is the number of embedded patterns and \u03be\u00b5 i = \u00b11 (\u00b5 = 1, . . . , p; i = 1, . . . , N). Let us consider about the probability distribution of a set of patterns {\u03be\u00b5 i }(\u2261{\u03be\u00b5 i | i = 1, . . . , N; \u00b5 = 1, . . . , p}). We suppose that the probability that arbitrary nearest neighboring sites of \u00b5-th pattern are \u03be\u00b5 i and \u03be\u00b5 j respectively is proportional to\nwhere the parameter J0 controls the degree of the correlation between arbitrary nearest neighboring sites. Let us write P(\u03be\u00b5 i = \u03be\u00b5 j ) and P(\u03be\u00b5 i = \u2212\u03be\u00b5 j ) as the probability of \u03be\u00b5 i = \u03be\u00b5 j and \u03be\u00b5 i = \u2212\u03be\u00b5 j , respectively. Then, the ratio of the former to the later is given by\nFor the case of J0 = 0, Eq. (5) becomes P(\u03be\u00b5 i = \u03be\u00b5 j ) = P(\u03be\u00b5 i = \u2212\u03be\u00b5 j ). Hence there is no correlation between i and j sites of \u00b5-th patterns and embedded patterns correspond to \u201crandom patterns\u201d. On the other hand, for the case of J0 \u2192\u221e, we obtain P(\u03be\u00b5 i = \u2212\u03be\u00b5 j ) = 0. Namely, the value of \u03be\u00b5 i is same as that of \u03be\u00b5 j with probability one. Applying Eq. (4) to all nearest neighboring pairs \u27e8ij\u27e9, we obtain the probability distribution for \u00b5-th pattern as\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\uf8ed \uf8f8 Supposing that each pattern is generated by Eq. (6) independently, a set of embedded patterns {\u03be\u00b5 i } is generated by the following probability distribution\n\uf8ed \uf8f8 Here, the normalization factor c is given by {Z0(J0/\u221ap)}p. Note that Eq (6) corresponds to the Boltzmann weight of the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model on the square lattice whose interaction is given by 1/\u221ap at temperature 1/J0. Hence embedded patterns are same as snapshots of equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations for it. This Ising model was explicitly solved in [5] and it is known that there is a critical point at K = Kc = 0.44, where K denotes the ratio of the temperature to the strength of the interaction. This model has a ferromagnetic solution for J0/\u221ap > Kc and a paramagnetic solution for J0/\u221ap < Kc. From this fact, in our model system, embedded patterns have a long-range order for J0 > Kc\u221ap, on the other hand, there is no long-range correlation for J0 < Kc\u221ap. Fig. 1 shows typical three examples of embedded patterns. In the next section, we briefly review the features of the phase diagrams of our model systems obtained by Nishimori et al [4].\n# II. GENERIC QUALITATIVE PHASE DIAGRAM\nBefore we explain our analysis of maximum number of embedded patterns, in this section, we briefly review the results by Nishimori et al [4]. Note that their treatments, namely, the gauge transformations and the Peierls arguments are applied to not only the two-dimensional systems but also the systems in arbitrary dimension. Fig. 2 shows the qualitative phase diagram with axes of temperature T and a parameter J0 controlling the structure of patterns for a fixed value of p. In general, this system has three phases: paramagnetic(P), ferromagnetic(F), and retrieval(R)(or spin glass(SG)) phases. Each phase is characterized by the following three order parameters\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\nwhere \u27e8\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u27e9means thermodynamic average. The above three order parameters q, mF and mR represent the Edwards-Anderson spin glass order parameter, the ferromagnetic order parameter, and the overlap between the \u00b5-th pattern and the network state {Si}, respectively. The paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, retrieval and spin grass phase are characterized by the above three order parameters as q = mF = mR = 0; q > 0, mF > 0; q > 0, mR > 0 and q > 0, mF = mR = 0, respectively. Applying the gauge transformations to this system, we obtain the internal energy [\u27e8E\u27e9] and the overlap [mR] on the lines \u03b2(= 1/T) = J0 in the phase diagram as follows.\nwhere E0(\u03b2/\u221ap) is the internal energy of the ferromagnetic Ising model corresponding to the partition function Z0(\u03b2/\u221ap), and m0(\u03b2/\u221ap) is the spontaneous magnetization of the same model. Here, the expression of [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7] means the average over the distribution (8). Both E0(\u03b2/\u221ap) and m0(\u03b2/\u221ap) generally have singularities at some critical point when spatial dimensionality exceeds one. Let us suppose that \u03b2/\u221ap = Kc is the critical point. Then Eqs (12) and (13) mean that the internal energy and the overlap of our system have the same singularity at \u03b2/\u221ap = Kc. This implies a phase transition and the boundary between [mR] \u0338= 0 and [mR] = 0 crosses this point on the line \u03b2(= 1/T) = J0 (it is denoted by M in Fig. 2). We should notice that this point is also the critical point of the embedded patterns. When the value of p is small, a typical phase diagram is given by Fig. 2(a). For this case, there is a possibility to exist the retrieval phase in the region denoted by R. In the same figure, The region F\u2019 is the ferromagnetic phase with finite overlap. It is important to notice that this system is not meaningful as an associative memory for J0 > Kc\u221ap since embedded patterns have a long-range ferromagnetic order like the right of Fig. 1, and patterns become correlated each other. With this fact in mind, we do not regard this region as a retrieval phase. When the value of p increases, the critical point J0 = Kc\u221ap moves to right. On the\n(10)\n(11)\n[\u27e8E\u27e9]\n(12)\n(13)\nother hand, by using the Peierls argument, the ferromagnetic phase still exists in the almost same region. Taking those facts into account, there exists a critical number of patterns pc above which (p > pc) the ferromagnetic phase is split into two regions, that is, the ferromagnetic phase with finite overlap (F\u2019) and the ferromagnetic phase without retrieval order (F). At the same time, the retrieval phase in the small-p case is replaced by the spin glass phase because the region with finite overlap is limited to F\u2019 (Fig. 2(b)). In summary, there exists a critical number of patterns pc blow which (p < pc) the retrieval phase exists there if any, while for p > pc the retrieval phase vanishes and this network cannot retrieve embedded patterns. However, the value of pc is not yet evaluated quantitatively at all in [4]. Following section, we investigate it especially in the case of two-dimensional system on the square lattice.\n# IV. ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEM\nWe begin with the case of p = 1. In this case, the system is identical to the ferromagnetic Ising model and the retrieval solution of the system corresponds to the ferromagnetic solution of the ferromagnetic Ising model. In the case of square lattice, the critical temperature of the ferromagnetic Ising model is Tc = 2.27, therefore the system has a retrieval solution at T < Tc.\n# B. The case of p \u22653\nWe next analyze the case of p \u22653. There is a good evidence to show that the retrieval phase does not exist for this case. Let us start with investigating if there is a state which has a smaller energy than retrieval one. Substituting Si = \u03be1 i (for all i) into Eq. (2) and averaging it over the distribution (8), we obtain the energy per neuron of the pure retrieval state\n(14)\nwhere C1(J0/\u221ap) is the nearest-neighbor correlation function of the ferromagnetic Isin model on the square lattice. The explicit form of C1 is\nWe also rewrite the energy per neuron of the pure ferromagnetic state in terms of C1(J0/\u221ap). Substituting Si = 1(for all i) into Eq. (2) and averaging it over the distribution (8), we obtain\nWe next investigate the properties of the function C1(J0/\u221ap). It is written in terms of he partition function (7) as follows.\n1 N log Z0 \ufffdJ0 \u221ap \ufffd = log \ufffd 2 cosh 2J0 \u221ap \ufffd + 1 2\u03c02 \ufffd\u03c0 0 \ufffd\u03c0 0 log(1 \u22124\u03ba cos \u03c91\u03c92)d\u03c91d\u03c92,\nwhere\nubstituting 2 cosh \u00b5 = 1/2\u03ba| cos \u03c91| into Eq. (18) and usin\nwe obtain\nSubstituting Eq. (22) into the right hand side of Eq. (17), explicit solution of C1(J0/\u221ap) written by\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\nwith \u03ba1 = 4\u03ba and\n  Fig. 3 shows the shape of Eq. (23). From Eqs. (14), (16) and (23), we obtain rigorous values of grand state energies of the pure retrieval and the pure ferromagnetic states. Now we calculate the condition that the pure ferromagnetic state has a smaller energy than the retrieval one, that is to say, the condition for [ER] > [EF]. We rewrite this inequality by using Eqs. (14) and (16), then we obtain\nAs C\u22121 1 is a monotonically increasing function and C\u22121 1 (1) = \u221e(see Fig .3), Eq. (26) leads\nwhere C\u22121 1 denotes the inverse of the function C1. We find that the pure ferromagnetic state has a smaller energy than the pure retrieval one as long as this condition is satisfied. As J0 is finite, p \u22653 must be satisfied because C\u22121 1 is a monotonically increasing function and C\u22121 1 (1) = \u221e. Further, it is easy to confirm the following inequality.\nTaking into account [EF] \u2212[ER] < 0 under the condition (27) and p \u22653, [EF] gets smaller relatively as p gets larger. As the result, the pure ferromagnetic state has a smaller energy than the pure retrieval one for T = 0, J0 > U\u221ap and p \u22653. The value of U is 0.38 for p = 3, and U < 0.38 for p > 3 because of the monotonically increasing property of C\u22121 1 . Note that U is always less than Kc = 0.44. We investigate the energy landscape around pure retrieval state further. Let us calculate the energy increase per interaction when the state changes from pure retrieval one. The energy stored in an interaction is given by\n(24)\n(25)\n(26)\n(27)\n(28)\n(29)\nSubstituting Si = \u03be1 i , Sj = \u03be1 j into Eq. (29), we obtain the energy stored between i-th and jth neurons of the network retrieving 1-th pattern completely. As the same way, substituting Si = \u03be1 i , Sj = \u2212\u03be1 j into Eq. (29) gives the energy of the interaction for the case where j-th neuron changes from retrieval state. Subtracting the former from the latter, and averaging it over the distribution (8), we obtain the energy increase per interaction when the state changes from retrieval one.\nThe value of [dER] is always positive, and it is expected that the energy increases on the average when the state changes from pure retrieval one. We estimate the energies of the finite overlap states as follows. Let n be the number of neurons whose states are opposite to the retrieval states. The relation between n and mR is given by\nIf n is not large, the number of interactions between the retrieval state and opposite state is expected to be about 4n because the number of nearest neighboring neurons is 4 and neurons whose states are opposite to retrieval states lie sparsely almost all case. Therefore, the energy of the system per neuron whose overlap is mR is expected to be\nFig. 4 shows the result of numerical simulation and compare it with Eq. (32). We set parameter values as p = 3 and J0/\u221ap = 0.39(> U) at the simulation. We generate 105 sample states for each value of mR and evaluate [EmR]. Eq. (32) agrees with the result of the simulation near mR = 1, although it does not agree with the simulations for the case of small mR. This is clearly because the number of interaction between the retrieval state and opposite state is smaller than 4n for large n. Regardless of it, the energy tends to increase as mR gets smaller, and the state near mR = 1 is likely the smallest energy among the finite overlap states. Almost same argument can be applied to the ferromagnetic state, and the state near mF = 1 is the smallest energy among the ferromagnetic order. Taking into\n(30)\n(31)\n(32)\naccount [ER] > [EF], the energy of ferromagnetic order is expected to be smaller than that of retrieval order as long as p \u22653 and J0 > U\u221ap are satisfied. We also investigate the stability of pure retrieval state. The variance of dER is given by\n\uf8f3 Using Eqs. (14) and (33), The ratio of [dER]2 to this variance is obtained by\nPartially differentiating above equation by p (the value of C1 is fixed), we obtain the following\nPartially differentiating above equation by p (the value of C1 is fixed), we obtain the following inequality.\nThis means that the more the value of p gets large, the more the energy is likely to decrease when the state changes from pure retrieval one, although it increases on the average. Therefore, the pure retrieval state becomes unstable for large p. We can roughly estimate the value of p for which the pure retrieval state gets unstable by\nIn Fig. 5, we plot the minimum value of p that is satisfied with Eq. (36). For example, Eq. (36) is satisfied with p \u22658 for J0/\u221ap = 0.43. Note that this is probably overestimating and the value of p is likely smaller. We confirm this argument in numerical simulations of the dynamics at T = 0. Fig. 6 shows a typical example of how the overlap mR depends on Monte Carlo step in computer simulations, in which N = 100 \u00d7 100 and J0/\u221ap = 0.43. The state of network starts with the embedded pattern itself. In this simulations, the pure retrieval state is already unstable for p = 3, and the network falls into a certain local minimum near mR = 1. This implies that the pure retrieval state is no longer stable for p \u22653. Taking the above all results into account, we show that there is no retrieval phase if p \u22653. As we have seen, U is always smaller than Kc = 0.44 for p \u22653, and the region of J0 > U at T = 0 is not retrieval phase but must be ferromagnetic one. This is because the ferromagnetic states have smaller energy than the retrieval one, and the state with minimum\n(33)\n(34)\n(35)\n(36)\nenergy appears with probability one for T \u21920 in terms of the Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, the boundary of [mR] = 0 is prohibited from landing at J0 < Kc\u221ap on the J0 axis like L2 in Fig. 7, and it should land at J0 = Kc\u221ap from point M vertically like L1. Hence, there is no retrieval phase in the region J0 < Kc\u221ap (for all T) because the region with finite overlap is limited at J0 > Kc\u221ap. As a result, the phase diagram should be like Fig. 2(b) and we conclude that the retrieval phase does not exist for the case of p \u22653.\n# C. The case of p = 2\nFor the case of p = 2, we cannot immediately conclude that there exists the retrieval phase although the energy of a perfect retrieval state is smaller than that of ferromagnetic one. We have to compare the energy of the retrieval state with that of the spin glass state. However, it is very hard to calculate the grand state energy of the spin glass state because the Hamiltonian of this system has a very complicated energy landscape. For this case, in order to evaluate the grand state of the Hamiltonian, we should carry out simulated annealing, for example. However, up to now, we do not yet obtain reliable results. This will be our future problem.\n# V. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we investigated the maximum number of embedded patterns in the twodimensional Hopfield model storing structured patterns. As a result, we found that this system can retrieve a pattern at T < 2.27 in the case of p = 1, however the retrieval phase does not exist for the case of p \u22653. In other words, this system cannot retrieve more than three patterns whose value is independent of the size of the system. This result agrees with a consideration of networks with randomly diluted synapses, in which pc is proportional to the average connectivity per neuron [6]. Namely, we can see from this argument that the value of pc for our network is finite because the average connectivity per neuron is four (finite number). However, our result is more strict than that from this argument. Moreover, pc \u22643 is satisfied with any value of J0 (even the conventional \u201crandom patterns\u201d). This implies that the smallness of the value of pc is due to the dimensionality two of the network rather than spatially correlated patterns. This argument also implies\nthat although there are several modifications in order to improve storage capacity with spatially correlated patterns (see [7], for example), these modifications are not expected to be remarkable improvements for our model system. From above all arguments, We conclude that storage capacity of associative memory is strongly restricted by the spatial structure of the network.\nREFERENCES\nFIG. 1: Typical examples of embedded patterns.
