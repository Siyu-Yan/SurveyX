   - **Intuition**: Explain the thought process or inspiration behind the creation of the benchmark. What existing problems or observations led to the development of this new benchmark?
   - **Opinion**: Share the authors' perspective on the importance of the benchmark and its potential impact on the field.
   - **Innovation**: Highlight the novel aspects of the benchmark. How does it differ from previous benchmarks, and what improvements does it offer?\
   - **Benchmark abbreviation**: The abbreviation of benchmark name.

4. **Dataset**:
   - **Source**: Explain how the dataset was created or sourced. Was it collected from real-world data, synthetically generated, or a combination of both?
   - **Description**: Provide details about the dataset, including its size, how it is distributed, and any unique characteristics that make it suitable for the benchmark.
   - **Content**: List the types of data included in the dataset, such as text, images, audio, or other forms of data, and how they relate to the problem being benchmarked.
   -**Size**: The total amount of data included in the benchmark. If the provided information does not specify the size, return "-". To represent size numbers using the international standard thousand separator format, use commas, such as 1,000,000 or 4,754. Just provide one final size number, no other content is needed. 
   -**Domain**: The specific application domains covered by the benchmark (e.g., mathematics, coding). Extract only one primary domains. The extracted domain should be sufficiently specific rather than overly broad. For example, domains like 'Natural Language Processing','Artificial Intelligence' or 'Machine Learning' are overly broad, while 'Mathematics' or 'Text Summarization' are sufficiently specific.
   -**Task Format**: The specific types of tasks included in the benchmark (e.g., Question Answering, text classification). Extract only one main task types.  

5. **Metrics**:
   - **Metric Name**: The evaluation metrics used in the benchmark (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). Extract one or two primary metrics. If the metric name has a corresponding abbreviation, please use the abbreviation. For example, for "Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10)", the output should be "MRR@10". Only provide the names of the two main metrics.. 
   - **Aspect**: Specify which aspects of model performance are being measured. Are they accuracy, speed, resource usage, or something else?
   - **Principle**: Describe the rationale behind the choice of metrics. What theoretical or practical considerations guided their selection?
   - **Procedure**: Outline the steps or methods used to evaluate model performance using the chosen metrics.

6. **Experiments**:
   - **Model**: Identify the models that were tested in the benchmark. Were they state-of-the-art models, baseline models, or a mix of both?
   - **Procedure**: Detail the experimental setup, including how the models were trained, the parameters used, and any other experimental conditions.
   - **Result**: Present the outcomes of the experiments. How did the models perform, and were the results statistically significant?
   - **Variability**: Discuss how the variability in the results was accounted for, such as through multiple trials or different subsets of the dataset.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the key findings of the experiments and the implications of the benchmark. What conclusions can be drawn from the results?

8. **Discussion**:
   - **Advantage**: Discuss the strengths of the benchmark and how it contributes to the field.
   - **Limitation**: Identify any limitations or potential drawbacks of the benchmark and how they might affect its use or interpretation.
   - **Future Work**: Suggest areas for future research or development based on the strengths and weaknesses of the current benchmark.

9. **Other Info**: 
    - Is there any other information not mentioned above? List any additional relevant details in key-value format to ensure a comprehensive understanding.
