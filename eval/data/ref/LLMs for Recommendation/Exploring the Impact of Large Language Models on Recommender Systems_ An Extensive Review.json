While departing from traditional models, this unified approach retains the capacity for personalized and contextually-aware recommendations, offering a more cohesive and adaptable alternative to segmented retrieval and ranking structures.\n\n# 2.2 Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nLLMs, such as Llama [51], GPT [43], T5 [44], etc., are versatile in NLP. BERT is an encoder-only model with bidirectional attention, GPT employs a transformer decoder for one-directional processing, and T5 transforms NLP problems into text generation tasks. Recent LLMs like GPT-3 [4], Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) [50], Pathways Language Model (PaLM) [6], and Vicuna excel in understanding human-like textual knowledge, employing In-Context Learning (ICL) [11] for context-based responses.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/cf54/cf543666-8667-488e-8c07-18502d65a15b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">y of Recommendation in LLMs, encompassing LLMs in Recommendation Systems, Sequential & Conversational ems, Personalized recommender system Knowledge Graph enhancements, Reranking, Prompts, and Fine-Tuned densed overview of models and methods within the Recommendation landscape.\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Taxonomy of Recommendation in LLMs, encompassing LLMs in Recommendation Systems, Sequential Recommender Systems, Personalized recommender system Knowledge Graph enhancements, Reranking, Prompt LLMs. Offers a condensed overview of models and methods within the Recommendation landscape.\n</div>\ng the Impact of Large Language Models on Recommender Systems: An Ex\n\n# LLMs in Recommender Systems\n\nIn this section, we will investigate how LLMs enhance deep learningbased recommender systems by playing crucial roles in user data collection, feature engineering, and scoring/ranking functions.

It excels in prompt tuning, maintaining parameter efficiency. Real-world deployment insights include strategies like late interaction, parameter sharing, pruning, and early-exiting. M6-Rec excels in zero/few-shot learning across tasks like retrieval, ranking, personalized product design, and conversational recommendation. Notably, it is deployed on both cloud servers and edge devices. PBNR: Li et al. [29] introduce PBNR, as a distinctive news recommendation approach using personalized prompts to predict user article preferences, accommodating variable user history lengths during training. The study applies prompt learning, treating news recommendation as a text-to-text language task. PBNR integrates language generation and ranking loss for enhanced performance, aiming to personalize news recommendations, improve user experiences, and contribute to human-computer interaction and interpretability. LLM-REC: Lyu et al. [37] introduce LLM-Rec, a method with four\n\nprompting strategies: basic, recommendation-driven, engagementguided, and a combination of recommendation-driven and engagemen guided prompting. Empirical experiments demonstrate that integrating augmented input text from LLM significantly enhances recommendation performance, emphasizing the importance of diverse prom and input augmentation techniques for improved recommendation capabilities with LLMs. Recommender Systems in the Era of LLMs: Fan et al. [13] survey the innovative use of prompting in tailoring LLMs for specific downstream tasks, focusing on recommendation systems. They review methods involving task-specific prompts to guide LLMs, aligning downstream tasks with language generation during pre-training. The study discusses techniques like ICL and CoT in the context of recommendation tasks within RecSys. It also covers prompt tuning and instruction tuning, incorporating prompt tokens into LLMs and updating them based on task-specific recommendation datasets.\n\nRecommender Systems in the Era of LLMs: Fan et al.

TALLRec: Bao et al. [2] introduce a Tuning framework for Aligning LLMs with Recommendations (TALLRec) to optimize LLMs using recommendation data. This framework combines instruction tuning and recommendation tuning, enhancing the overall model effectiveness. Initially, a set of instructions is crafted, specifying task input and output. The authors implement two tuning stages: instructtuning focuses on generalization using self-instruct data from Stanford Alpaca, while rec-tuning structures limited user interactions into Rec Instructions. Flan-T5: Kang et al. [24] conduct a study to assess various LLMs with parameter sizes ranging from 250 million to 540 billion on tasks related to predicting user ratings. The evaluation encompassed zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. For fine-tuning experiments, the researchers utilized Flan-T5-Base (250 million parameters) and Flan-U-PaLM (540 billion parameters). In zero-shot and few-shot experiments, GPT-3 models from OpenAI and the 540 billion parameters Flan-U-PaLM were employed. The experiments revealed that the zero-shot performance of LLMs significantly lags behind traditional recommender models. InstructRec: Zhang et al. [71] introduce InstructRec for LLM-based recommender systems, framing the task as instruction following. Using a versatile instruction format with 39 templates, generated fine-grained instructions cover user preferences, intentions, task form and contextual information. The 3-billion-parameter Flan-T5-XL model is tuned for efficiency, with the LLM serving as a reranker during inference. Selected instruction templates, along with operations like concatenation and persona shift, guide the ranking of the candidate item set. RecLLM: Friedman et al. [15] propose a roadmap for a large-scale Conversational Recommender System (CRS) using LLM technology. The CRS allows users to control recommendations through real-time dialogues, refining suggestions based on direct feedback. To overcome the lack of conversational datasets, the authors use\n\n# 6 Evaluating LLMs in Recommender System\n\nrecommendation systems, evaluating their effectiveness and impact on recommendation quality. iEvaLM: Wang et al. [56] introduce an interactive evaluation approach called iEvaLM, centered on LLMs and utilizing LLM-based user simulators. This method enables diverse simulation of systemuser interaction scenarios. The study emphasizes evaluating explainability, with ChatGPT demonstrating compelling generation of recommendations. This research enhances understanding of LLMs\u2019 potential in CRSs and presents a more adaptable evaluation approach for future studies involving LLM-based CRSs. FaiRLLM: Zhang et al. [70] posit that there is a need to assess RecLLM\u2019s fairness. The evaluation focuses on various user-side sensitive attributes, introducing a novel benchmark called Fairness of Recommendation via LLM (FaiRLLM). This benchmark includes well-designed metrics and a dataset with eight sensitive attributes across music and movie recommendation scenarios. Using FaiRLLM, an evaluation of ChatGPT reveals persistent unfairness to specific sensitive attributes during recommendation generation. RankGPT: Sun et al. [47] proposed a instructional techniques tailored for LLMs in the context of passage re-ranking tasks. They present a pioneering permutation generation approach. The evaluation process involves a comprehensive assessment of ChatGPT and GPT-4 across various passage re-ranking benchmarks, including a newly introduced NovelEval test set. Additionally, the researchers propose a distillation approach for acquiring specialized models utilizing permutations generated by ChatGPT.\n\ng the Impact of Large Language Models on Recommender Systems: An Ex\n\n# 7 Conclusion\n\nIn summary, this paper explores the transformative impact of LLMs in recommender systems, highlighting their versatility and cohesive approach compared to traditional methods.
