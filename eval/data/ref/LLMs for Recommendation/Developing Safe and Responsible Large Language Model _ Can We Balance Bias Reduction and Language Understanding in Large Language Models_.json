Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have greatly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) in areas such as text generation, machine translation, question-answering systems, and more [1]. However, these generative AI methods paradoxically also bring more challenges, such as biased outputs, stereotypes, and ethical concerns [2]. For example, this example demonstrates how a neutral prompt, when given to LLM such as ChatGPT and Copilot, can yield outputs that inadvertently reflect gender bias. Below, we present the prompt and the averaged response from multiple trials from these models.\n\u2217Corresponding author Email address: shaina.raza@vectorinstitute.ai (Shaina Raza) Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nAugust 8, 2024\nDescribe a successful CEO.\nThe generated responses on average are depicted below:\nA successful CEO is typically described as a man who is decisive, assertive, and has a strong vision for his company. He often has a background in business or finance and leads his team with confidence.\nThis output demonstrates a clear bias by assuming that a successful CEO is typically a man, which reinforces gender stereotypes. In the context of this study, we define \u201cbias\" as the presence of unsafe text that includes discrimination, toxicity, stereotypes, or harm within linguistic outputs or broader language usage, as explored in the relevant literature. [3]. Recent research into LLM evaluations [4, 5, 6, 2, 7] also show that LLMs can unintentionally echo negative stereotypes related to gender, race, and other demographics [8, 9]. To address biased outputs from LLMs, initial strategies have focused on implementing guardrails to monitor and adjust user interactions with LLM applications [10]. Additional techniques include Redteaming, which uses simulated attacks to evaluate and strengthen system robustness against biases [8]. During the fine-tuning stage, advanced methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and context distillation are used to refine model responses [11, 12, 13]. Additionally, some approaches incorporate adversarial demonstrations to prepare models against potential malicious attacks [14, 15]. Related works on mitigating biases in texts prompt LLMs to critically examine their own biases [16], while some methods are based on techniques such as output filtering, ranking, and calibration [17]. Techniques like data augmentation and balancing, as well as embedding-based, probability-based, and generated text-based debiasing, are also used [18]. Research shows that while prompt engineering is generally resource-efficient, fine-tuning LLMs for various tasks often yields better results [19]. The primary goal of all these approaches is to encourage self-reflection, identify and amend biased content, and adjust probabilities to reduce bias in LLM outputs. Despite significant recent efforts to mitigate bias in language generation, the complete elimination of bias presents a complex and ongoing challenge. Intensive mitigation strategies can often lead to overfitting, which occurs when a model becomes too specialized to the training data and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data [20]. This overfitting risks the loss of language understanding or knowledge retention because the model may focus too much on reducing bias at the cost of retaining the broader context and nuances of language [19]. State-of-the-art LLMs such as Llama2/3 [21] and the Mistral-series [22] are inherently finetuned for safety through demonstrations and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) by their respective developers and contributors. Research indicates that using fewer demonstrations with these safe models can lead to a reduction in biases [16]. Furthermore, incorporating more demonstrations (examples) in prompts has been shown to yield better results [23, 24]. However, it is worth considering whether an additional layer of instruction-based finetuning, employing targeted prompts and demonstrations, could further enhance the ability of these models to handle nuanced tasks such as unbiased content generation [3]. Thus, integrating both strategies\u2014prompt engineering and fine-tuning\u2014may provide a more comprehensive approach to\neffectively reducing biases in LLM outputs. In this work, we aim to explore the effectiveness of this additional fine-tuning layer. Research Questions. This research primarily focuses on developing and implementing an approach to detect and mitigate linguistic biases in textual content while preserving the integrity of knowledge. The following questions guide our study: \u2022 RQ1: How effective is our approach at reducing biases in texts, and how much knowledge is retained in the process? \u2022 RQ2: To what extent does fine-tuning outperform few-shot and zero-shot prompting in reducing specific types of bias and retaining task-specific knowledge in LLMs? \u2022 RQ3: Does instruction-based fine-tuning on top of inteherently safe models enhance their ability to handle custom tasks (e.g., bias mitigation) without compromising their integrity? Research Objectives. The specific objectives of our research are: 1. Develop a safe and responsible LLM capable of identifying biased or harmful content and transforming it into a safe, unbiased version 1. 2. Ensure that the process of converting unsafe texts to safe versions, a language generation task, does not diminish the model\u2019s natural language understanding capabilities. 3. Apply targeted fine-tuning to safe models, such as Llama2 or alike, to improve their adaptability and effectiveness in producing safe text without losing knowledge retention.. Contributions. The primary focus of this study is the development and implementation of a safe and responsible LLM capable of generating safe variations of unsafe content. This effort is centered on language generation rather than classification tasks. The primary contributions of our research are outlined as follows: 1. We present a curated dataset of social media content containing potentially unsafe (biased) texts, along with unbiased (safe or benign) variations (counterparts) prepared by our team of subject matter experts. 2. We introduce the Safe and Responsible Large Language Model (SRLLM), an instruction fine-tuned LLM built on top of the already safe Llama2-7B-Chat model [25], to instruction fine-tune the LLM on our custom dataset. 3. We have employed QLoRA [26], a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to optimize resource usage while maintaining computational performance during training. This approach is generalizable to other LLMs, as we have made the code and data available for reproducibility and further research. Empirical Analysis Our empirical analysis, conducted on both our training set and out-of-distribution datasets such as Toxigen, BOLD, and StereoSet, demonstrates the better performance of our instruction fine-tuned model, SRLLM, in reducing unsafe content and retaining knowledge in the language generation task.

This approach outperforms both smaller encoder-decoder fine-tuned language\n1In this context, \u201cUnsafe\" refers to texts that are biased, toxic, harmful, carry stereotypes, or convey negative sentiments, while \u201csafe\" texts are benign or debiased.\nmodels and base LLMs operating under zero-shot and few-shot prompt settings. The retention of important knowledge within the LLM is confirmed through targeted experiment on language understanding and human evaluation. While we acknowledge the ethical implications associated with modifying user content as in our work, our primary objective remains the development of a methodology that guarantees the production of safe LLM outputs. This approach strives to respect copyright boundaries and maintain user trust and autonomy. We believe such as approach is usable in fields like journalism, where presenting stories that are both accurate and unbiased is essential.\n# 2. Methodology\nProblem Definition. The core objective of our study is to address the challenge of generating safe variations of potentially unsafe content. This task involves language generation processes rather than content classification, positioning our research within the domain of creating responsible and non-harmful textual outputs.\nPreliminaries. In this research, we define \u2018bias\u2019 as content in generative AI that exhibits hate, toxicity, offensiveness, or discrimination, which might perpetuate stereotypes or unfair portrayals of specific groups based on age, gender, race, or religion [15, 27, 28]. The major risks that we identify in this work with LLM outputs are: Bias, where LLMs may generate content favoring or disfavoring certain demographic groups (based on age, gender, race, religion, social status, etc.) unfairly; Toxicity, which includes aggressive or offensive content such as hate speech, insults, and threats, compromising the respectfulness of online interactions [6]; Stereotyping, where LLMs propagate generalized, often inaccurate assumptions about groups or individuals, leading to non-diverse representations [29]; and Harm, where there is a risk of LLMs producing content that could incite violence or societal harm, undermining public safety and well-being [30]. We employ the following terms for training models: Fine-tuning, which refers to adjusting the weights of a pre-trained model through additional training on a specific dataset to enhance its performance on related tasks; Prompts with demonstrations or few-shot learning, which involves providing the model with input-output example pairs (referred to as N-shots) along with prompts to guide accurate understanding and response generation [31]; and Instruction fine-tuning, which aims to improve a model\u2019s ability to follow explicit instructions and respond appropriately by training it on a set of such instructions [32]. Our SRLLM framework, illustrated in Figure 1, consists of a dataset layer and an efficient instruction fine-tuning method. The detailed steps of the framework are explained next.\n# 2.1. Dataset Preparation\nFor this study, we utilized a subset of our extensive dataset, which comprises approximately 3.7 million records 2. This dataset encompasses a diverse array of content sourced from both news platforms and social media, all of which is in English. It covers a wide range of over 200 different bias aspects, including ageism, sexism, and gender discrimination. From this comprehensive dataset, we specifically selected a sample of 20,000 records to form the Content Moderation Dataset (CMD). Each record in this sample contains more than 100-500 words, ensuring substantive content for analysis. We employed stratified sampling to\n2News Media Bias Full Data\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/3606/3606b82f-f7d1-40e5-b660-d4bfc0934684.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/9031/9031babd-7d93-41fa-96a9-897441afba1b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Framework for SRLLM, showing an end-to-end process.

The merged model weights result in a model capable of generating benign variations of unsafe content.</div>\nensure that all relevant categories of bias from our larger dataset were adequately represented. The purpose is to maintain a representative subset of the original dataset. This method enhances the generalizability of our findings by mirroring the diversity and complexity of bias present in the larger dataset. The process of building the CMD dataset took about three months, including data selection, preprocessing, annotation, and validation of labels. Annotation Procedure: The annotation task involves evaluating each piece of text to identify whether it is a bias, toxicity, negative sentiment (stemming from stereotyping), and harm and label it. The most important annotation task is to read each unsafe text and modify the texts to create benign or safe version - this is the ground truth label that we use in our model training and for evaluation. We assembled a diverse team of 20 volunteer annotators: five experts from disciplines (computer science, social science, psychology, and statistics), each mentoring three students (master\u2019s and one doctoral students) This team brings together a range of demographics and expertise. Initial tests confirmed their understanding and application of the annotation guidelines. Detailed annotation guidelines are provided in Appendix A.\nTo determine the labels for LLM risks categories (bias, toxicity, negative sentiment, and harm) and for the safe variation (we say as \u201cgold\" labels in this work), we used a majority vote. Expert intervention was employed to resolve any disputes or unclear cases. The consistency of the annotation process was evaluated using Fleiss\u2019 Kappa [33], with scores ranging from 0.62 to 0.74 across different risk categories (as shown in Appendix A), which indicates substantial agreement. An average score of 0.78 was calculated for the benign variation, which also indicates a strong consensus and demonstrating the reliability of the annotations 3. Dataset Schema: The dataset includes five labels: Bias, Toxicity, Negative Sentiment, Harm - for classification, and a Safe Variation that represents the ground truth label for safe language generation. We made our dataset available on Huggingface 4. The dataset schema is given below:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/b05a/b05a1fa2-29e0-49e9-a66f-eb6927e987ea.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Table 1: Details of the dataset.</div>\nAttribute\nValue\nDataset\nContent Moderation Dataset (CMD)\nDatapoints\n20,000\nClasses\nMultiple labels per datapoint: Bias, Toxicity, Sentiment, Harm\nClass Dist.\nBias: No (14,227) / Yes (5,772);\nToxicity: No (12,040) / Mild (5,293) / High (2,666);\nSentiment: Negative (9,028) / Neutral (8,370) / Positive (2,601);\nHarm: Low (14,151) / Med (3,932) / High (1,915);\nAnnot.: Unsafe (10,359) / Benign (9,640)\nSplit\nTrain 13,999 / Dev 1,999 / Test 4,001\nAppendix B.

Model Architecture\nAt the core of our work is the Llama2-7B-chat model [25], chosen for its ability to generate safe and benign language. The base Llama2-7B-chat model is already fine-tuned with safety\n3In our code, we have also provided an LLM-based annotation strategy for safe text generation to enhance scalability and ensure the reliability of outputs. 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/newsmediabias/instruction-safe-llm 5Disclaimer: For the sake of examples, these are truncated versions of the original data.\nID\n1001 Millennials\nOriginal\nMillennials are too sensitive and don\u2019t understand real work.\nBenign\nThere is a perception that millennials have different work ethics.\nAnnotations\nBias: Yes, Toxicity: No, Sentiment: Negative, Harm: Low, Target: Millennials\nBiased words\n\u201ctoo sensitive\", \u201cdon\u2019t understand real work\"\nID\n1002 Women in STEM\nOriginal\nWomen are not as good in STEM fields as men.\nBenign\nPeople of all genders can excel in STEM fields.\nAnnotations\nBias: Yes, Toxicity: No, Sentiment: Negative, Harm: Medium, Target: Women\nBiased words\n\u201cnot as good\"\nfeatures such as RLHF, context distillation, and safe demonstrations, details in original paper [25]. We added another layer of instruction fine-tuning to create SRLLM. This process involves further fine-tuning on our custom dataset. We selected the smallest variant, Llama2-chat-7B, for SRLLM, prioritizing ease of use and cost-effectiveness for inference and deployment. However, this approach is applicable to other variants of the Llama series and other chat/instruct models like Mistral. Instruction Design We adapt our CMD to adhere to the Alpaca instruction dataset format (Stanford format for instruction fine-tuned datasets) [34] for instruction fine-tuning. This instruction format follows structure as:\nWhere, \u00abSYS\u00bb: Represents the system prompt. It sets the context and provides general instructions for generating a response. [INST]: Denotes the instruction segment specific to each conversation turn. User prompts, which may contain both safe and unsafe examples, are accompanied by this prefix. User prompt: The user\u2019s input or query. Model Response: The generated response by the model based on the given system prompt and user prompt. An example for this is given below and the usage in Figure 2.\n<s>\u00abSYS\u00bb You are a helpful assistant. \u00ab</SYS\u00bb [INST] Respond to the user\u2019s post by providing a version that maintains the core message but is presented in a benign and unbiased manner. Ensure your response is free from toxicity, negative sentiments, and harm. The goal is to reframe the content to retain its original intent while ensuring it contributes positively to the conversation: \"Just saw the latest movie, and it was terrible! Waste of time\" [/INST] I appreciate your feedback! Movie preferences can be subjective, and it is okay to have different opinions. If you like, I can recommend some other films you might enjoy. </s>\nEfficient Fine-Tuning with QLoRA We utilized Quantized Language Model Optimization with Low Rank Adapters (QLoRA) [26], a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique via bitsandbytes and HuggingFace transformers Trainer, to fine-tune the Llama2-7B-Chat model on our custom instruction dataset in the creation of SRLLM.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/fd1e/fd1e9705-1dc4-436d-808c-166bacb605ba.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: Format for Instruction Fine-Tuning</div>\nQLoRA introduces an approach to efficient fine-tuning by reducing memory requirements, achieving strong results with minimal computational overhead. This approach optimizes finetuning a LLM by combining low-rank adapters and quantization, resulting in reduced computational resources while maintaining high model performance. We try to strike a balance between precision and resource efficiency using 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4) representation, double quantization, and paged optimizers. More details on QLoRA can be found in Appendix C. We also merged the model weights after fine-tuning to ensure stability and make it production ready. The merged model weights are made available 6 for use.\n# 3. Experimental Setup\n# 3.1. Training Details and Hyper-Parameters\nThe SRLLM model is fine-tuned on a single A100 GPU with support from 4 CPU cores employing PEFT and 4-bit quantization via QLORA (Rank=64, alpha=16, dropout=0.2) to manage GPU memory limits. Training was constrained to 1 epoch (with trials up to 5). We observed that more epochs led to over-fitting, similar to base Llama2-7B [21] paper experiences We used a batch size of 16 for training, 8 for evaluation, saved checkpoints every 25 steps with an early stopping after 3, and set the learning rate to 2e-4 and utilized paged AdamW optimizer \u201cpaged_adamw_32bit\u201d[26]. The max sequence length was limited to 1024 for faster inference, as well as greedy decoding strategy . The detailed hyper-parameters are in Table 3 and Table 4.

This carbon footprint [35] is notably low, especially when contrasted with more demanding tasks, such as a dense (full) fine-tuning, or training Llama2, which produced 539 tCO2eq, fully offset by Meta\u2019s sustainability efforts. The calculations for carbon footprinting are given in Appendix D.\n# 3.2. Evaluation Datasets\nTo assess our model, SRLLM, we utilize two primary types of evaluation datasets: In-house Test Set: Our proprietary CMD dataset with its test set of about 6,000 entries. Out-of-Distribution Datasets: We extend our evaluation to include several external datasets for a comprehensive safety analysis: 1. Toxigen [6]: We utilize Toxigen v2 [9], a refined version of the Toxigen dataset, minimizing annotator disagreement noise, with 430 examples across various demographics. 2. BOLD [4]: A Wikipedia-based dataset with 7,200 samples covering four demographic groups. 3. Stereoset [29]: Evaluates stereotype biases with 8,498 entries across multiple demographics.\n# 3.3. Baselines\nWe benchmark SRLLM using two primary baseline methods: Encoder-Decoder Baselines: We utilize fine-tuning on smaller encoder-decoder language models such as T5 [36], Flan T5 [32], and BART [37]. We used their large versions, which are still considered smaller than LLMs. These models are chosen for their capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. We fine-tuned these models\u2019 weights based on our unsafe-safe pair content data, the idea is to enable these models to learn the nuances and patterns associated with biased content, for the generation of safe and bias-free text. Prompt-based Baselines: We use state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama2-chat variants [25], Falcon7B [38], GPT-2 [39], and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models 7 using prompt-based techniques. This approach involves guiding the LLMs with specific prompts to generate desired outputs. We selected few-shot learning for these experiments, based on our preliminary analysis that demonstrated better performance compared to zero-shot learning. We opted for 2-shot learning to balance computational costs and performance, especially considering the cost implications of using paid models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\n# 3.4. Evaluation Metrics\n3.4. Evaluation Metrics Our evaluation metrics are designed to assess model accuracy, fairness, and output diversity: Accuracy-Based Metrics \u2022 Probability-based scoring: We employ the Perspective API [40] to measure the probability that a comment is perceived as toxic. This model provides a score indicating the likelihood that a text will be considered toxic or non-toxic. We specified the default threshold value. \u2022 LLM-based scoring: We utilizes OpenAI moderation API [41] which provides confidence scores. These scores indicate the likelihood of content being unsafe, and a preset threshold (we used 0.5) is used to determine whether content exceeds acceptable safety limits. \u2022 We also used the knowledge retention metric from DeepEval [42] that determines whether a LLM is able to retain factual information presented throughout a conversation. It takes the original text (unsafe example) and its variation (safe version) to determine whether the output response indicates an inability to recall said knowledge. We used GPT-4 as the backend LLM to evaluate LLM-based scoring. For our problem, a lower (\u2193) toxicity and content moderation scores are considered good, indicating reduced toxicity and improved content quality. Fairness Metrics These metrics are adapted from the StereoSet dataset [29]. \u2022 Language Modeling Score (LMS): LMS measures complete language understanding with a perfect score of 100 indicating full knowledge retention. A higher (\u2191) score is considered better. \u2022 Stereotype Score (SS): SS assesses the model bias by measuring its tendency toward stereotypical or anti-stereotypical terms. A score of 50 represents a neutral stance, while deviations from 50 indicate a bias toward stereotype or anti-stereotype terms.\nOur evaluation metrics are designed to assess model accuracy, fairness, and output diversity: Accuracy-Based Metrics\nOur evaluation metrics are designed to assess model accuracy, fairness, and output diversity: Accuracy-Based Metrics \u2022 Probability-based scoring: We employ the Perspective API [40] to measure the probability that a comment is perceived as toxic.

A higher (\u2191) score is considered better. An ideal ICAT score is 100, which a model would achieve if it scores a perfect LMS of 100 (indicating excellent language understanding) and an SS of 50 (showing no bias towards or against stereotypes). Content Diversity and Style Metrics Content-Length Entropy Normalization (CLEN): CLEN metric is adapted from the HolisticBias study [43], this metric involves a style classifier from ParlAI [44] that detects attributes like sentiment and writing style. CLEN measures the entropy of entence lengths to assess stylistic diversity. A higher (\u2191) CLEN score indicates better alignment with desired traits (e.g., kindness), suggesting stylistic consistency in benign contexts. Statistical Validation A t-test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between he means of two groups, or to compare a single group\u2019s mean against a known standard, helping o confirm if observed differences are statistically significant [45]. One-Sample T-Test [46]: We use this test to assess whether our instruction fine tuning approach has ignificantly improved the safety classification of texts by comparing stylistic features (positive vs negative traits in content) results before and after its application.\n\u2022 Idealized Context Association Test (ICAT): ICAT integrates LMS and SS to simultaneously evaluate language competence and bias neutrality. A higher (\u2191) score is considered better. An ideal ICAT score is 100, which a model would achieve if it scores a perfect LMS of 100 (indicating excellent language understanding) and an SS of 50 (showing no bias towards or against stereotypes).\n# 4. Results and Discussion\nWe conduct experiments to address our research questions: (1) whether we can reduce the generation of unsafe content while preserving the knowledge and language understanding capabilities of our model, (2) whether instruction fine-tuning provides added value compared to approaches based on prompts alone, and (3) whether instruction fine-tuning atop models already tuned for safety enhances the performance and capabilities of these models beyond what is achieved with base models.\nDifferent Datasets We evaluated the performance of SRLLM by comparing it against state-of-the-art models using three distinct test sets for toxicity and harmful content reduction. The goal of this experiment is to see if task-specific instruction fine-tuning can reduce biases in language generation. Pre-Safety Scores: The results in Table 5 show the initial scores on the original texts. The results indicate that the toxicity scores and moderation content scores, as measured by the Perspective API and OpenAI content moderation respectively, are very high, revealing toxic and biased content. Post-Safety Scores: The results after using different models for safety (fine-tuning or prompts and our model instruction fine-tuning) reveal a reduction in toxicity and harmful content . Our instruction fine-tuned SRLLM model, which is built on top of the default safety fine-tuned Llama27B-chat model, consistently outperformed other models in terms of low toxicity and content moderation scores. We also observe that the decoder-only models (Llama2, Falcon, GPT models) perform better than encoder-decoder architecture models (T5, BART). The base Llama2-7B-chat models with prompts demonstrated strong performance, and show much lower toxicity and bias or harmful percentages compared to other baselines. Model size seems to marginally impact results, as Llama2-7B performs slightly better than Llama2-13B (a similar observation was found in the original Llama2 study [25]), which may be attributed to the challenges brought by more model parameters. LLMs such as Llama2, Falcon, GPT models, and\nTable 5: Comparative evaluation of SRLLM and other models across different test sets: Our test set, Toxigen, and BOLD datasets. We present toxic generation percentages (%) from Perspective API (PersP score) and moderation scores from OpenAI Moderation (OpenAI scores).

Encoder-Decoder models (T5 and BART) were fine-tuned (FT) on our data and tested on these test sets.

Main Finding: The results primarily address RQ2, demonstrating the added value of instruction fine-tuning through SRLLM model , when applied to inherently safer models (e.g., Llama2-7Bchat), addressing RQ3. The results also show that auto-regressive decoder-only LLMs more effectively recognize and handle toxic content compared to relatively smaller encoder-decoder models.\n4.2. Evaluating the Effectiveness of SRLLM in Comparison with Various Language Models Across\nWe evaluated various models to mitigate toxicity across different demographics. Our methods included fine-tuning smaller language models like T5 and BART, LLMs such as Llama2-7Bchat, Falcon7B, and GPT-3.5/4, using prompts ,and instruction fine-tuning for SRLLM on our CMD dataset. The models were tested on the Toxigen test set, with toxicity levels assessed using ToxiGen-RoBERTa [6], a model specifically trained for this dataset. We presented the toxicity scores as averaged probabilities in percentage form. The results presented in Table 6 indicate that GPT-4 and SRLLM consistently outperformed other models in generating texts with minimal toxic content across diverse demographic groups. Specifically, GPT-4 recorded the lowest toxicity percentages for groups including women (1.02%), LGBTQ (0.67%), and several others as highlighted in Table 6. SRLLM also showed robust performance, especially among groups such as individuals with physical disabilities (0.59%) and the Chinese demographic (0.98%). In contrast, models such as T5 and BART were less effective, exhibiting the highest percentages of unsafe content across most demographic categories.\nTable 6: Reducing Toxicity for Demographic Groups on the Toxigen Test Set. This table displays the percentage (%) of toxic content detected after applying various debiasing techniques. A lower score (\u2193) indicates fewer toxic outputs, which is the desired outcome. The best (lowest) scores for each demographic are highlighted in light gray. Initially, toxicity scores on the original test set are presented, followed by scores after each model\u2019s intervention to generate benign variations. The Llama2 and Falcon models utilized prompts with 2-shot demonstrations; T5 and BART were fine-tuned; and SRLLM underwent instruction fine-tuning.

Instruction fine-tuning models on the top of inherently safe models (e.g. our model SRLLM compared to base Llama2) perform better than simple fine-tuning or prompt-tuning, addressing RQ3.\n4.3. Evaluating the Effectiveness of SRLLM in Comparison with Various Language Models for Stereotypes We assessed SRLLM alongside other leading models using the StereoSet [29] to determine bias across four demographic categories: gender, profession, race, and religion. Our analysis utilized the Intrasentence task from StereoSet, chosen over the Intersentence Test due to its suitability for detailed language generation and bias evaluation. We employ well-established baselines such as Flan-T5, GPT-2 Large, and DialogGPT, each fine-tuned on our dataset. These models were selected based on their adaptability and performance on similar tasks. The goal of this experiment is to see if task-specific instruction fine tuning can reduce biases in text, while retaining language understanding. The results presented in Table 7 demonstrate the superior performance of SRLLM in reducing stereotypical biases across multiple dimensions: Gender, Profession, Race, and Religion. In particular, SRLLM achieves an impressive balance between reducing biases and preserving language modeling capabilities, which is evidenced by higher ICAT scores across various demographics. SRLLM exhibits balanced performance in the Gender and Profession categories, with high LLMS of 90.05 and 90.58 percentages respectively, while maintaining low SS (close to 50) and high ICAT scores (above 50). In the Race and Religion categories, SRLLM not only achieves high LMS scores (92.44 for Race and 93.68 for Religion) but also records the lowest SS (closer to 50). Main Finding: SRLLM is an instruction fine-tuned model that reduces stereotype biases while preserving the knowledge and language understanding of the model, addressing the RQ1.\nTable 7: Performance of different models on the Intrasentence test of the StereoSet for evaluating stereotypical bias across Gender, Profession, Race, and Religion demographics, utilizing metrics Stereotype Score (SS) (Closer to 50 is better), Language Modeling Score (LMS), and Idealized CAT Score (ICAT) (Higher \u2191the better, closer to 100).

Evaluation of SRLLM on Text Style Factors\nText style factors refer to the distinctive elements that influence the presentation and perception of written text, including vocabulary, sentence structure, tone, voice, and formatting [47]. These factors define the unique character and readability of the text, contributing to how effectively it communicates with specific audiences.\n# 4.4.1. One-Sample t-Test for Safety Measures\n4.4.1. One-Sample t-Test for Safety Measures To evaluate the effectiveness of SRLLM, we conducted a controlled experiment utilizing the ParlAI style classifier [47] to analyze the stylistic attributes of texts before and after safety interventions (using our instruction fine-tuning method to debias the texts). This experiment aimed to determine whether these safety interventions led to significant changes in linguistic style and CLEN scores. For instance, a higher CLEN value associated with a positive trait like \u2018scholarly\u2019 indicates a more consistently positive style. We want to see after debiasing, whether we got higher CLEN with many positive traits. The experiment was performed using a one-sample t-test, comparing the mean style scores of 16,602 samples from our training set against a hypothesized neutral value, which indicates no unsafe generations. The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that there is no significant change in style due to the our safety measures, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) posits a discernible shift towards safer expressions. The results, highlighted in Figure 3, demonstrated a statistically significant change in the linguistic style post-intervention, with a p-value of less than 0.00001, leading to the rejection of\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/daae/daaec54a-4902-44cd-b3d5-07a9d6c86ec9.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3: One-Sample t-Test Result for Safety Measures.

The significant t-statistic of 28.17 further confirmed the effectiveness of the safety measures, showing a pronounced improvement in the model output. This result indicates that our approach successfully mitigates bias by removing negative styles, and keep the safety of language generated by SRLLM. It shows a substantial shift in stylistic features towards more safe and inclusive traits.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/e547/e54770f1-bdc7-445c-9a68-8a937b5f82e1.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4: Comparison of Stylistic Traits Before and After Safety Intervention</div>\n4.4.2. Stylistic Variations Post-Safety Interventions We also show the effectiveness of safety interventions on SRLLM through style classification on original unsafe text and then benign (safe) generations through our model. Figures 4 show a significant reduction in negative traits and an enhancement of positive attributes in style postintervention. Figure 4 illustrates contrasting collections of personality traits, each with a different\nfocal point and emotional tone. The first network, shown in Figure 4(a), emphasizes more negative or challenging traits such as \u201cNeurotic\",\u2018 \u2018Hostile\". and \u201cCruel\". In contrast, the second diagram, shown in Figure 4(b), highlights positive and socially admirable qualities like \u201cCaring\", \u201cCompassionate\" , and \u201cHonest\". Main Finding: Instruction fine-tuning, as in the case of SRLLM, tends to reduce negative styles in the content, and more positive traits in the language generations, answering the RQ2 and also RQ1.\n# 4.5. Evaluating Instruction Fine-Tuning Versus Prompt-Based Approaches\nThe goal of this experiment is to evaluate whether instruction fine-tuning enhances model performance and bias mitigation more effectively than zero-shot and few-shot prompting methods, to answer our RQ2. We used Llama2-7B-chat model as baseline for its capabilities and safety features as baseline for this experiment. The settings are: Zero-Shot Prompting: The base Llama2 model is used in a zero-shot setting where it responds to prompts designed to test bias without any prior specific training on the examples. Few-Shot Prompting: The model is tested with a few examples before being prompted to respond, allowing it to adapt its responses based on the limited provided context. Instruction Fine-Tuning: The model is fine-tuned using our custom dataset, resulting in SRLLM, which includes a balanced mix of biased and unbiased text examples. The fine-tuning process involves adjusting the model\u2019s parameters to better recognize and correct unsafe (biased) content. To evaluate, we utilized both our in-house test set and the ToxiGen database. For scoring, we employed the LLM-based moderation API provided by OpenAI. Additionally, we calculated the Knowledge Retention metric to assess whether the LLM retains factual information from the input in its generated output.\nTable 8: Comparison of Llama 2-7B models for different variation prompts with demonstrations (zero-shot, 2-shot, 5-shot) using OpenAI moderation (Mod.) score and Knowledge Retention on our test set. Lower OpenAI Mod. scores (\u2193) indicate lower unsafe texts, while higher Knowledge Retention scores (\u2191) suggest improved retention of useful information. Best scores are highlighted in bold. For the Llama2-7B model, the chat version is used. The original text scores are based on examples before safety interventions (pre-safety scores), and post-safety scores are when methods were used to produce safer text generation.\nText\nOur Test Set\nToxigen Test Set\nOpenAI Mod.\nScore \u2193\nKnowledge\nRetention \u2191\nOpenAI Mod.\nScore \u2193\nKnowledge\nRetention \u2191\nPre-safety Scores\nOriginal Texts\n57.82%\nN/A\n69.78%\nN/A\nPost-safety Scores\nLlama2-7B (zero-shot)\n21.14%\n64.32%\nN/A\n70.19%\nLlama2-7B (2-shots)\n13.05%\n72.25%\n14.88%\n66.93%\nLlama2-7B (5-shots)\n12.54%\n73.89%\n12.23%\n79.34%\nSRLLM\n05.92%\n88.94%\n05.10%\n80.53%\nThe analysis in Table 8 explores the comparative performance of Llama2-7B-chat models with prompts (zero, 2, and 5 shots) and our instruction fine-tuned SRLLM model.\nPre-Safety Scores: The original sentences show high moderation scores of 57.82% for our test set and 69.78% for the Toxigen test set, indicating a need for intervention. Post-Safety Intervention: Post-intervention, we observe a desirable decrease in moderation scores and an increase in knowledge retention as we escalate the number of examples in prompts from zero to 2 to 5 shots. Our SRLLM model demonstrates a significant reduction in moderation scores to 5.92% on our test set and 5.10% on Toxigen, respectively, while achieving the highest scores in knowledge retention (88.94% and 80.53%, respectively). Main Finding: Instruction fine-tuning LLMs on custom data can effectively reduce bias and toxicity while retaining substantial knowledge, addressing RQ1. Prompts with demonstrations also proves beneficial, particularly when applied in conjunction with models inherently fine-tuned for safety, such as Llama2. More data improves performance; for example, 5-shot prompts performed better than 2-shot and zero-shot, with instruction fine-tuning performing best, addressing RQ2 Achieving optimal knowledge retention is best achieved through instruction fine-tuning in this experiment.\n# 4.6. Human Evaluation on SRLLM\nThe goal of this experiment is to see if our task-specific instruction fine tuning can retain language understanding while reducing biases (RQ1). We assess SRLLM and its variants for their ability to minimize harm, bias, toxicity, and stereotypes, targeting content neutrality and inclusivity through human evaluation. The model variations include: Safe_PEFT-1_ep, SRLLM fine-tuned for one epoch and PEFT- our default setting. Safe_PEFT-5_ep, SRLLM extends PEFT to five epochs. Safe_Dense-IFT, SRLLM subjected to dense fine-tuning over five epochs . Safe_Dense-IT or instruction-tuning , SRLLM adjusting prompts on base model without fine-tuning (using dense method) . A team of five evaluators from our team conducts a rapid, blind assessment of 100 examples of the safe text generations, each contain instances of bias, toxicity, negative sentiments and harm.

Nevertheless, this response successfully expands the narrative to encompass a broader range of\ndemographics, emphasizing the diversity and complexity of tech entrepreneurship. The scores indicate\na commendable performance in promoting safety and understanding.\nThe evaluation of SRLLM model variations in Table 9 demonstrates diverse approaches to enhancing text neutrality and inclusivity. The Safe_PEFT-1_ep model performed best in eliminating unsafe generations (through examples emphasizing diversity and skill in tech entrepreneurship), resulting in the highest scores for safety and language understanding. Conversely, the Safe_PEFT5_ep model introduced other language (e.g., Spanish) phrases and fell slightly short of achieving full inclusivity. The Safe_Dense-IFT model showed diversity in tech but concluded its responses abruptly, which affected its evaluation scores. Meanwhile, the Safe_Dense-IT model, despite an unnecessary apology for bias, effectively broadened the demographic narrative, scoring well in\nboth safety and understanding. Main Finding: Our current model setup with instruction fine-tuning on our dataset for one epoch performed best. We are able to reduce bias while retaining knowledge. This qualitative assessment on 100 samples is also shown in Figure 5, where we observe that our default SRLLM method with 1 epoch performs best.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f93f/f93f67d1-6a2a-4cac-8a8b-61ca711f924f.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n\nFigure 5: Safety vs. Language Understanding Scores.

Limitations\nCoverage and Diversity of Data: Our dataset, comprising annotated news and social media articles, spans various aspects and media. However, it should not be considered fully representative or balanced concerning media coverage across different countries or regions, nor does it cover all the demographics in the globe comprehensively. This may result in a lack of full representativeness in the distribution of identified demographic techniques. AI Safety and Biases in LLMs: The advancement of LLMs necessitates a focus on AI safety. Despite efforts to address a wide array of potential issues, the rapid development of AI technology could introduce unforeseen challenges. Innovations in LLMs bring about new complexities, making it difficult to address all possible concerns fully. Bias: Bias is a significant and subjective issue. Data biases reflect systemic issues, and despite implementing annotation guidelines, the subjectivity in data annotations and biases of annotators and evaluators cannot be entirely eliminated. Efforts to cover a broader range of safety risks and bias aspects, especially those related to demographics, do not encompass the full scope of potential biases.\nMethodological Soundness: The development and evaluation of LLMs in this study encounter some limitations due to the high computational power required, limiting accessibility for smaller research groups. Despite utilizing PEFT and QLora techniques as main optimization methods, specialized knowledge required for deploying and optimizing models presents a barrier to widespread adoption. Dense fine-tuning introduces training complexities without guaranteed performance improvements. Moreover, evaluating LLMs, including quantitative and qualitative measures, often relies on platforms like OpenAI, which requires access keys, limiting evaluation flexibility and impacting reproducibility and transparency. Theoretical and Practical Implications The theoretical implications of our study involve advancing the understanding of how biases in LLMs manifest and can be mitigated, contributing to the broader discourse on AI ethics and safety. Practically, our findings inform the development of more robust and equitable AI systems by highlighting the necessity for diverse datasets and the challenges of AI interpretability and accessibility.\n# 5.2. Future Directions\nAddressing the limitations identified in our study, future research should aim to curate more globally representative datasets and enhance AI safety protocols to adapt to evolving challenges. Developing sophisticated bias mitigation strategies is also crucial. Methodological advancements that lower computational demands and simplify the optimization process are needed to enable wider accessibility for diverse research groups. Furthermore, establishing open, flexible evaluation frameworks and engaging in discussions around ethical considerations and potential regulatory frameworks are essential. These efforts will collectively advance the development of safe and responsible LLMs that align well with societal values. While the proposed method has shown effectiveness in enhancing the model\u2019s safety and knowledge retention, it might be worthwhile to assess its impact on the model\u2019s general capabilities in various NLP tasks. Future work should focus on conducting comparative evaluations using datasets like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) [48]. These evaluations will provide insights into whether the safety improvements lead to any significant trade-offs in the model\u2019s general performance. In future work, we aim to enhance the reliability of our bias assessment by conducting a larger number of trials and employing advanced statistical techniques, such as chi-square tests, to robustly analyze gender representation in model outputs. This will enable a more definitive conclusion about the presence of gender or other biases.\n# 6. Conclusion\nIn this study, we introduced SRLLM for safe language generations, this approach is trained on our custom dataset of instructions featuring original texts (potentially unsafe) and their benign variations to ensure safe language generation. This model offers reduced inference and deployment costs. It has proven competitive in many benchmarks. We have detailed the methods and techniques to develop our models, emphasizing their adherence to safety and language understanding principles. Committed to transparency and safety, we plan to enhance the model and data in future work.\n# CRediT authorship contribution statement\nShaina Raza: Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization, Methodology, Experiments, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Supervision.

Annotation Guidelines\nIn the development of this guide, a dedicated group of 15 annotators volunteered their expertise and time to ensure the highest standards of accuracy and sensitivity in identifying unsafe content generation. This diverse team consisted of five experts in fields related to computer science, language, psychology, and ethical computing, each accompanied by three students. An annotation guide is designed for the annotators for identifying and effectively neutralizing instances of toxicity, stereotyping, bias, and harm in textual content. This guidelines covers a diverse array of target groups and individuals, ranging from those in different age groups \u2013 children, teenagers, adults, and seniors \u2013 to individuals with varying educational backgrounds, geographic locations, and occupations, including healthcare professionals, engineers, teachers, and artists. Our aim with this annotation guideline is to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their background or characteristics, can engage with content that adheres to the principles of fairness, inclusivity, and respect. Below is a list of target groups for which unsafe language generation happens that need to consider when annotating textual content and creating benign alternatives. Target Group Attributes: Age Group: Children, Teenagers, Adults, Seniors; Education Level: High School, College, Postgraduate; Geographic Location: Urban, Suburban, Rural; Occupation: Healthcare Professionals, Engineers, Teachers, Artists; Language: English Speakers, Spanish Speakers, Mandarin Speakers; Hobbies & Interests: Sports Enthusiasts, Music Lovers, Travel Enthusiasts; Family Status: Singles, Married, Parents, Divorced; Technology Adoption: Early Adopters, Technophobes; Environmental Concerns: Eco-conscious, Sustainability Advocates; Dietary Preferences: Vegetarians, Vegans, Meat Lovers; Political Affiliation: Conservative, Progressive; Religion: Buddhism, Catholic, Christian, Islam; Race & Ethnicity & Nationality: Asian, Black, Chinese, Indian, Korean-Chinese, Southeast Asian, White; Gender & Sexual Orientation: LGBTQ+, Men, Women; Miscellaneous: Ageism, Disabled, Diseased, Feminist, Physical Appearance, Socio-economic Status.\nIn the development of this guide, a dedicated group of 15 annotators volunteered their expertise and time to ensure the highest standards of accuracy and sensitivity in identifying unsafe content generation.

Bias manifests as the display of favoritism or prejudice towards certain individuals, groups, or ideas, often leading to unfair treatment or judgment. It involves a preference for one perspective or the unfair exclusion of others, thereby distorting objectivity and creating an unequal or discriminatory impact. An example of bias is : Clearly, anyone with a real education would naturally steer clear of such backward political views. It is obvious that educated individuals know better. This statement is biased, saying that educated people uniformly reject certain political views. Annotators should identify the assumption of uniformity in thought among educated people, highlight the biased words, as: real education, backward political views, educated individuals know better,\nrecommending a more inclusive statement like, \u201cIndividuals of all educational backgrounds can hold a variety of political views, reflecting the diversity of thought and opinion\". Toxicity encompasses language that not only exhibits harm, aggression, or disrespect but also creates an atmosphere of hostility, offense, or harm towards individuals or groups. It includes expressions that go beyond civil discourse and can lead to emotional or psychological harm by targeting someone\u2019s identity, intelligence, or worth. Consider an example: It is baffling how anyone with half a brain could possibly agree with such a ludicrous stance. Only an idiot would fail to see the flaws\". Here, the language is blatantly toxic, attacking the intelligence of those with differing opinions. This sentence should be labeled as \u2018toxic\u2019. When annotating, phrases like anyone with half a brain , Only an idiot should also be marked as toxic. A benign revision might be, \u201cThis stance may not be universally accepted, as it has several notable flaws that could be overlooked\u201d. Stereotyping occurs when sweeping generalizations are made about a particular group of people, often based on limited or inaccurate information. These generalizations tend to be overly simplistic and fail to account for the diversity and individuality within the group, resulting in a misleading or unfair portrayal. Specifically, we focus on the negative aspects of sentiment associated with such stereotypes. An example might be, Every tech enthusiast I have met so far is socially awkward, buried in their gadgets, and incapable of holding a meaningful conversation about anything else. This stereotype unjustly labels a diverse group. Annotators should highlight the entire stereotypical portrayal, highlighting phrases socially awkward,buried in their gadgets,incapable of holding as conveying stereotypes, suggesting a benign variation such as, \u201cMany tech enthusiasts are deeply",
