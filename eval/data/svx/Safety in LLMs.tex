\section{Background and Definitions} \label{sec:Background and Definitions}



\subsection{Core Concepts of AI Safety} \label{subsec:Core Concepts of AI Safety}

AI safety is fundamentally concerned with ensuring that artificial intelligence systems are designed and operated in a manner that is reliable, equitable, and devoid of harm. One of the critical principles is the interpretability and explainability of AI models, which are essential for fostering trust and understanding among users and stakeholders \cite{lin2023interpretabilityframeworksimilarcase}. The lack of explainability, particularly in systems such as deep reinforcement learning, can significantly undermine trust and usability in practical applications. Enhancing transparency is thus crucial for ensuring fairness and accountability in AI systems.



The adaptability of AI systems to dynamic and non-stationary environments is another core aspect of AI safety. AI systems must be robust enough to handle changes in external conditions, ensuring their integrity and reliability in real-world applications. This adaptability is vital for enabling AI systems to generalize across diverse tasks without overfitting, thereby enhancing their utility and safety \cite{kaur2024cropcontextwiserobuststatic}. 



Addressing computational complexity is also a fundamental principle of AI safety, as it affects the effectiveness of AI models in various applications. The optimal design and orchestration of AI systems are critical for resolving complex tasks across diverse environments, emphasizing the need for efficient computational strategies \cite{stogin2022provablystableneuralnetwork}. The RoleCraft framework, for example, advances personalized interactions by ensuring realistic and context-aware AI behavior, which is an essential component of AI safety.



AI safety also involves mitigating the risks associated with noisy labels, which can lead to inaccurate training and biased models. Ensuring the quality of data inputs and outputs is essential to maintain the reliability of AI systems, particularly in applications such as scene graph generation (SGG).



Furthermore, safeguarding sensitive information is a cornerstone of AI safety. Techniques such as label differential privacy (LabelDP) are employed to protect the privacy of data labels, allowing for the secure use of non-sensitive inputs in machine learning models. This approach is crucial for preventing unauthorized data access and ensuring the confidentiality of user information \cite{wang2024espewrobustcopyrightprotection}.



The principles of AI safety also extend to ensuring that systems are free from vulnerabilities, especially in contexts where ethical implications are significant, such as in the navigation of mobile robots for humanitarian mapping and disaster response \cite{brandao2020fairnavigationplanninghumanitarian}. Additionally, AI systems must not perpetuate biases, particularly in sensitive applications like news coverage.



In environments where uncertainty arises from the agent's lack of knowledge about the environment's responses, modeling risk-sensitivity is essential. This involves developing systems that can appropriately manage and respond to risks, thereby enhancing their safety and robustness \cite{wang2023environmenttransformerpolicyoptimization}.



In sum, the core concepts of AI safety revolve around creating AI systems that are interpretable, adaptable, computationally efficient, free from noisy influences, and protective of user privacy. These principles guide the ongoing efforts to develop AI technologies that are not only powerful but also aligned with ethical and safety standards.



\subsection{Defining Generative AI} \label{subsec:Defining Generative AI}

Generative AI refers to a class of algorithms capable of creating new content such as text, images, and other forms of data by learning from existing datasets. This technology has significantly impacted various fields by enabling machines to autonomously generate human-like content. Central to generative AI is its ability to produce novel outputs that are not directly programmed, effectively simulating creative processes \cite{touvron2023llama}. Large language models (LLMs) exemplify this capability, having made substantial progress in generating coherent and contextually appropriate text \cite{tang2023mvpmultitasksupervisedpretraining}.



The application of generative AI spans multiple domains. In natural language generation (NLG), algorithms are utilized to generate human-like text, thereby enhancing the interactivity and engagement of AI-driven applications \cite{tang2023mvpmultitasksupervisedpretraining}. In financial reasoning, generative AI processes extensive financial documents, offering insights and facilitating decision-making through LLMs \cite{reddy2024docfinqalongcontextfinancialreasoning}. It is also employed in creating synthetic datasets based on the generative processes of probabilistic topic models, ensuring the availability of structured data for various analytical purposes \cite{shi2019newevaluationframeworktopic}.



Generative AI's versatility is further demonstrated by its ability to autonomously create diverse and increasingly complex learning environments while optimizing agents to solve them, as evidenced by the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm \cite{wang2019pairedopenendedtrailblazerpoet}. Moreover, visual language models like Flamingo integrate text and visual data to generate new content, highlighting the adaptability of generative AI in processing multimodal inputs \cite{alayrac2022flamingo}. The Pathways Language Model (PaLM) further exemplifies this adaptability by generating diverse content types from a vast dataset, showcasing the scalability of generative AI \cite{chowdhery2023palm}.



In the domain of user-driven creativity, generative AI models facilitate the creation of images based on user prompts, underscoring the role of user input in shaping content diversity \cite{palmini2024patternscreativityuserinput}. This interaction between users and AI systems highlights the democratizing potential of generative AI in creative industries.



However, generative AI also poses risks, such as the potential for generating radicalizing content, as seen with models like GPT-3, which can contribute to online radicalization \cite{mcguffie2020radicalizationrisksgpt3advanced}. Additionally, the inability of existing diversity metrics to effectively account for item prevalence, particularly in cases of significant imbalance, can lead to inaccurate assessments of diversity in generated outputs \cite{pasarkar2024cousinsvendiscorefamily}.



Generative AI represents a transformative force across various domains, enhancing natural language processing, financial analysis, and creative industries. Its capability to autonomously generate diverse and contextually relevant content continues to drive advancements in artificial intelligence, offering new opportunities for application and exploration.




\subsection{Language Model Evaluation Criteria} \label{subsec:Language Model Evaluation Criteria}

\input{benchmark_table}

Evaluating language models is paramount to ensuring their effectiveness, reliability, and ethical deployment across various applications. The criteria for assessment encompass a range of metrics and methodologies designed to capture the multifaceted nature of language model performance. A key component of model evaluation involves assessing both accuracy and F1-score, which together provide a detailed understanding of model performance by quantifying the correctness of predictions and the balance between precision (the proportion of true positive results among all positive predictions) and recall (the proportion of true positive results among all actual positive instances), thereby offering a holistic view of effectiveness across various natural language processing tasks. \cite{shi2019newevaluationframeworktopic,nimase2024morecontextshelpsarcasm}

In addition to traditional accuracy metrics, the evaluation of language models often involves assessing their ability to handle complex tasks such as multi-turn dialogues and instruction-following scenarios. Benchmarks specifically designed for these tasks provide a more accurate reflection of human preferences and expectations, thereby aligning model outputs with user needs \cite{JudgingLLM1}. Furthermore, the evaluation process must account for the reasoning capabilities of language models. Techniques such as few-shot prompting combined with rationale generation enable the assessment of coherent reasoning processes without the necessity of extensive training datasets, thereby enhancing the evaluation of logical coherence in model outputs \cite{wei2022chain}.

The evaluation of language models also extends to the detection and measurement of biases, particularly intersectional biases that arise from combinations of social categories. Benchmarks developed for this purpose allow for the comparison of bias levels across different models, ensuring that outputs are equitable and free from discriminatory tendencies \cite{magee2021intersectionalbiascausallanguage}. Moreover, the performance disparity between generative and evaluative tasks presents another dimension for evaluation. By using Question-Answering (QA) as a case study, benchmarks can highlight the differences in model capabilities, guiding improvements in both content generation and evaluation \cite{oh2024generativeaiparadoxevaluation}.

In the context of topic modeling, novel metrics such as normalized mutual information (NMI) are employed to quantify the overlap between planted and inferred topic structures at the token level. This approach enables a nuanced evaluation of topic coherence and relevance, which is crucial for applications requiring structured content generation \cite{shi2019newevaluationframeworktopic}.

The evaluation of language models is further complicated by the limitations of existing benchmarks, particularly in neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Challenges such as the use of back-translation and forward translation techniques necessitate innovative evaluation frameworks that can accurately capture the nuances of translation tasks \cite{bogoychev2020domaintranslationesenoisesynthetic}. Table \ref{tab:benchmark_table} provides a comprehensive overview of the benchmarks employed for evaluating language models, highlighting their diverse applications and the metrics used for performance assessment.















\section{AI Safety in Generative AI} \label{sec:AI Safety in Generative AI}


In the contemporary landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), safety considerations are paramount, particularly as generative AI technologies become increasingly prevalent. The complexities associated with ensuring the safe deployment of these systems necessitate a comprehensive examination of the challenges that arise in this domain. As illustrated in \autoref{fig:tree_figure_AI Sa}, the hierarchical categorization of key concepts related to AI safety in generative AI outlines the primary challenges in AI safety and evaluation, frameworks and guidelines for safe AI development, as well as bias and ethical concerns. This figure emphasizes the need for robust safeguards, comprehensive evaluation frameworks, and ethical deployment strategies to ensure the responsible development of generative AI technologies. This section will delve into the various challenges in AI safety and evaluation, highlighting the critical issues that must be addressed to foster the responsible development of generative AI technologies.

\input{figs/tree_figure_AI Sa}
 






\subsection{Challenges in AI Safety and Evaluation} \label{subsec:Challenges in AI Safety and Evaluation}

The field of AI safety and evaluation is fraught with numerous challenges that hinder the development of secure and reliable AI systems. One primary challenge is the susceptibility of models like GPT-3 to manipulation, enabling the generation of targeted extremist content with minimal technical expertise \cite{mcguffie2020radicalizationrisksgpt3advanced}. This ease of misuse underscores the need for robust safeguards against the propagation of harmful content. Additionally, existing watermarking techniques for intellectual property protection are easily detectable and removable, which compromises their effectiveness and poses a significant challenge to maintaining the integrity of AI-generated content \cite{wang2024espewrobustcopyrightprotection}.

These challenges are illustrated in \autoref{fig:tiny_tree_figure_0}, which categorizes the main issues in AI safety and evaluation into three primary areas: AI manipulation, personalization limitations, and interpretability and evaluation. Under AI manipulation, specific issues such as GPT-3 misuse and watermarking concerns are highlighted. Personalization limitations address intra-user variability and the necessity for context adaptability. Finally, interpretability and evaluation emphasize the transparency of structural causal models (SCMs) and the existing gap in semantic metrics.

Another critical issue is the inadequacy of current personalization methods, which often fail to account for intra-user variability, resulting in suboptimal performance in novel contexts \cite{kaur2024cropcontextwiserobuststatic}. This limitation is particularly problematic in applications requiring adaptability to dynamic user needs. Furthermore, the interpretability of AI systems remains a significant concern, as current SCM methods do not adequately explain their results. This lack of transparency can lead to algorithmic discrimination and erode trust in automated decision-making processes \cite{lin2023interpretabilityframeworksimilarcase}.

The challenge of accurately evaluating AI systems is compounded by the absence of universally accepted metrics that align closely with human judgment, particularly in tasks involving semantic similarity and style transfer \cite{yamshchikov2020styletransferparaphraselookingsensible}. This gap in evaluation metrics can lead to discrepancies in assessing the effectiveness of AI models and methods. Moreover, standard empirical risk minimization approaches do not consider the causal influences of features, allowing classifiers to produce similar predictions with vastly different underlying causal mechanisms \cite{sen2018supervisingfeatureinfluence}. This oversight can result in models that are not robust to changes in feature distributions or causal relationships.

In dynamic environments, the complexity of policies and the identification of hidden assumptions that may undermine security present additional challenges \cite{kammller2020applyingisabelleinsiderframework}. The ability to rigorously analyze these policies is crucial for maintaining the security and reliability of AI systems in real-world applications. Addressing these multifaceted challenges is essential for advancing AI safety and evaluation methodologies, ensuring that AI systems are both effective and secure in their deployment.

\input{figs/tiny_tree_figure_0}
\subsection{Frameworks and Guidelines for Safe AI Development} \label{subsec:Frameworks and Guidelines for Safe AI Development}

The establishment of frameworks and guidelines for safe AI development is crucial for ensuring both the ethical integrity and operational safety of AI systems. A notable approach in this domain is the utilization of runtime verification techniques, such as SGUARD, which automatically identifies and rectifies vulnerabilities in smart contracts, thereby providing a robust framework for safe AI deployment in blockchain environments \cite{nguyen2021sguardfixingvulnerablesmart}. This method exemplifies the integration of automated verification tools in enhancing the security and reliability of AI systems.



Incorporating risk sensitivity into AI frameworks is another essential aspect of safe development. The Epistemic Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning method introduces utility functions that model risk preferences, allowing AI systems to make decisions that account for potential uncertainties and risks \cite{eriksson2019epistemicrisksensitivereinforcementlearning}. This approach ensures that AI systems are equipped to handle unpredictable scenarios while maintaining operational safety.



Collaborative frameworks that bring together multidisciplinary expertise are also pivotal in the development of safe AI systems. The creation of expert communities, as advocated by Korre, facilitates the exchange of knowledge and strategies across various domains, addressing the complex and interdisciplinary challenges inherent in AI development \cite{korre2023takesvillagemultidisciplinaritycollaboration}. Such collaborations enhance the robustness of AI systems by integrating diverse perspectives and expertise.



In the realm of intellectual property protection, techniques like ESpeW offer a sophisticated watermarking solution that injects unique identifiers into embeddings generated by language models. This method ensures the robustness of watermarking while minimizing its impact on the quality of embeddings, thereby safeguarding AI-generated content from unauthorized use \cite{wang2024espewrobustcopyrightprotection}.



Security frameworks that utilize formal verification methods, such as the Isabelle Insider framework, provide comprehensive tools for modeling and analyzing insider threats. By integrating Kripke structures and temporal logic, this framework facilitates dynamic reasoning and enhances the security policies governing AI systems \cite{kammller2020applyingisabelleinsiderframework}. Such formal methods are instrumental in preemptively identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities.



Collectively, these frameworks and guidelines underscore the multifaceted approach required for safe AI development, encompassing automated verification, risk-sensitive decision-making, collaborative expertise, intellectual property protection, and formal security analysis. These methodologies contribute to the creation of AI systems that are not only innovative but also aligned with safety and ethical standards across various applications.

\caption{Examples of Frameworks and Guidelines for Safe AI Development}\label{fig:retrieve_fig_1}
\end{figure}
}


As shown in \autoref{fig:retrieve_fig_1}, In the rapidly evolving field of AI, ensuring the safety and reliability of generative AI systems is of paramount importance. The example presented in the figure highlights two distinct frameworks that underscore the necessity of adhering to robust guidelines for safe AI development. The first example, "OpenAI codebase next word prediction," illustrates a line graph that captures the intricate relationship between compute in bits per word and bits per word, with distinct lines representing observed data, predictive modeling, and the capabilities of GPT-4. This visualization underscores the importance of understanding and predicting AI behavior to ensure its safe deployment. The second example, "ControlNet: A Neural Network Architecture for Zero-Convolutional Learning," showcases the architecture of ControlNet, emphasizing a novel approach to neural network design where a locked neural network block works in tandem with a trainable copy. This setup highlights the innovative strategies being employed to ensure AI models are both effective and secure, as the locked component suggests a protective measure to maintain system integrity. Together, these examples provide valuable insights into the frameworks and guidelines that are crucial for developing safe and reliable AI technologies. \cite(GPT-4Techn0,zhang2023adding)
\subsection{Bias and Ethical Concerns} \label{subsec:Bias and Ethical Concerns}

The deployment of AI systems, particularly those involving generative AI and language models, entails significant ethical considerations and biases that must be addressed to ensure responsible and equitable use. One of the critical challenges is the presence of intersectional biases within language models, which can perpetuate existing social inequalities if not properly managed \cite{magee2021intersectionalbiascausallanguage}. These biases arise from the complex interplay of various social categories, necessitating comprehensive evaluation frameworks that can identify and mitigate such disparities in AI outputs.



The adaptability of AI systems to dynamic environments is also a concern, as current studies highlight limitations in model adaptability and the maintenance of accuracy amid changing data distributions \cite{liu2023realtimesafetyassessmentdynamic}. These limitations can exacerbate biases if models fail to adapt to new contexts, leading to skewed or discriminatory outcomes. Furthermore, the training datasets used in developing language models like MVP can introduce biases that are then reflected in the models' outputs, raising concerns about the ethical implications of such biases in NLG tasks \cite{tang2023mvpmultitasksupervisedpretraining}.



AI writing assistants present another ethical dilemma, as they have the potential to manipulate opinions and influence user dependency and skill development \cite{benharrak2024deceptivepatternsintelligentinteractive}. The subtlety with which these tools can alter user perceptions underscores the need for further research into their long-term effects on user autonomy and decision-making capabilities.



In the realm of automated machine learning (AutoML), the integration of fairness-aware features is crucial for ensuring ethical deployments. Evaluations have highlighted the necessity for these tools to incorporate comprehensive fairness measures to prevent biased outcomes and promote equitable machine learning practices \cite{narayanan2023democratizecareneedfairness}.



Moreover, the accessibility of generative models, while offering numerous benefits, poses potential risks for misuse, such as the creation of deceptive content \cite{dhariwal2021diffusion}. This dual-use nature of generative AI necessitates the development of robust frameworks to prevent the propagation of harmful or misleading information.



The navigation of AI systems in real-world applications, such as mobile robots, also raises ethical concerns. Inherent biases in population distribution can lead to indirect discrimination in navigation paths, highlighting the need for fair and unbiased planning algorithms \cite{brandao2020fairnavigationplanninghumanitarian}.



Addressing biases and toxicity in large language models is paramount for responsible AI development. The potential for these models to produce harmful content necessitates ongoing efforts to refine and enhance their ethical deployment \cite{chowdhery2023palm}. Techniques like the generation of universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) have been proposed to improve model robustness, yet they must also ensure that enhancements do not inadvertently introduce new biases or ethical challenges \cite{zhang2024universaladversarialperturbationsvisionlanguage}.

\subsection{Generative AI Techniques} \label{subsec:Generative AI Techniques}

Generative AI techniques have evolved significantly, encompassing a variety of models and methodologies designed to produce high-quality synthetic data across different modalities. Among these, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) stand out for their unique approaches to data generation. GANs operate by pitting two neural networks against each other—a generator and a discriminator—to produce data that closely resembles the real-world distribution. This adversarial process encourages the generator to create increasingly realistic outputs, which has been particularly successful in image synthesis \cite{dhariwal2021diffusion}.

VAEs, on the other hand, utilize a probabilistic framework to model the underlying data distribution, allowing for the generation of new samples by sampling from the learned latent space. The integration of phoneme pre-training and differentiable duration modeling in VAEs, as seen in models like NaturalSpeech, enhances the synthesis process and reduces computational complexity, making them suitable for applications in text-to-speech synthesis \cite{tan2022naturalspeechendtoendtextspeech}.

Diffusion models represent another significant advancement in generative AI, focusing on the iterative refinement of noisy data to produce high-quality samples. These models have been benchmarked against GANs, demonstrating superior sample quality and diversity, particularly in image synthesis tasks \cite{dhariwal2021diffusion}. The diffusion process involves gradually denoising a sample, which allows for fine-grained control over the generation process, resulting in outputs that are both diverse and high-fidelity.

As illustrated in \autoref{fig:tiny_tree_figure_1}, the hierarchical categorization of generative AI techniques encompasses primary generative models such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models, along with innovative approaches like ControlNet and HFDA-Denoising, and transformer-based methods for text-to-image and cross-modal generation. Innovative approaches such as ControlNet employ 'zero convolutions' to connect pretrained models with trainable copies, effectively maintaining the original model's quality while mitigating noise during training \cite{zhang2023adding}. Meanwhile, HFDA-Denoising leverages human feedback to fine-tune generative models, improving the quality of denoised images in previously unseen domains \cite{park2023domainadaptationbasedhuman}.

In the realm of cross-modal generation, models like BLIP-2 utilize Querying Transformers (QFormer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment, enabling the generation of coherent outputs across different data modalities while keeping unimodal models frozen \cite{li2023blip}. This approach is particularly useful in applications requiring the integration of visual and textual data, such as image captioning and visual question answering.

The use of transformers in autoregressively modeling text and image tokens, as demonstrated by methods like those described in \cite{ramesh2021zero}, allows for the generation of images based on textual descriptions. This capability highlights the versatility of transformer architectures in bridging the gap between different data types, enabling seamless transitions from textual prompts to visual outputs.

The ongoing innovation in synthetic data generation is significantly fueled by a diverse range of generative AI techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches, which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-quality synthetic images, natural language, and diverse audio outputs. These advancements have led to enhanced applications across various domains, such as text-guided image generation and tabular data synthesis, showcasing the transformative impact of deep learning in fields like computer vision and natural language processing \cite{koo2023comprehensivesurveygenerativediffusion,dhariwal2021diffusion,palmini2024patternscreativityuserinput}. These techniques not only enhance the quality and diversity of generated outputs but also expand the potential applications of generative AI across various domains.
