Recent literature estimates 73.5% conversion of RBD to an overt neurodegenerative syndrome after a 12-year follow-up with a 6% risk of conversion per year (Postuma et al. 2019). To further explore the mechanisms behind these conversions and to develop neuroprotective therapies, larger cohorts of individuals with RBD must be identified. The\ngreatest hurdle to designing such studies is the slow and arduous RBD diagnostic process involving  polysomnography (PSG) recordings within sleep clinics, which are often under-staffed and  oversubscribed (severely limiting availability). PSG recordings are expensive, time consuming to setup,  can be uncomfortable and rely on labour intensive visual inspection of PSG data. Previous studies have  demonstrated that automated sleep staging and RBD detection was possible from a limited PSG  consisting of a electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electromyogram (EMG)  sensor (Cooray et al. 2018, 2019). This limited framework validates the possibility of a practical and  comfortable take-home device for sleep evaluation, of which only a limited number of clinical grade  devices supported by literature exist (Mikkelsen et al. 2017; Sterr et al. 2018).   Recent sleep research is uncovering an interplay between the central nervous system (CNS) and the  autonomic nervous system (ANS) that is regulated throughout sleep and its various stages (de  Zambotti et al. 2018). The ANS is responsible for regulating the majority of the body\u2019s internal systems,  such as blood pressure, breathing, body temperature, digestion, urine, and myocardial function. Of  particular interest is the change in heart rate variability (HRV) during sleep and how it might be  interpreted for automated three state sleep staging (Redmond and Mcnicholas 2007; Mendez et al.  2010; Xiao et al. 2013; Ebrahimi et al. 2015; Fonseca et al. 2015; Malik et al. 2018; Y\u00fccelba\u015f et al.  2018). For these studies automated sleep staging from ECG based features were achieved for three  sleep states, wake (W), REM and non-REM (REM). Additionally, recent literature indicated cardiac  autonomic dysfunction as a characteristic of RBD (Postuma et al. 2010; Sorensen et al. 2013; Bugalho  et al. 2018). Postuma et al. (2010) demonstrated through RR standard deviation and low frequency  components that there is a clear autonomic dysfunction in RBD participants compared to healthy  controls. Similarly, Sorenson et al. (2013) illustrated attenuated sympathetic activity in heart rate  variability in participants with PD and/or RBD compared to healthy controls. Bugalho et al. (2018)  attributed to RBD participants a reduction in parasympathetic modulation of heart rate variability in  relation to sleep stage transitions. Heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) are commonly used to  evaluate components of ANS functionality (Andreotti et al. 2018), conventionally measured by  electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors. ECG sensors are ubiquitous and user-friendly and therefore provide  an opportunity to further economise sleep staging and RBD detection by excluding the need for  cumbersome and expensive EEG sensors.   Furthermore, single sensor studies in sleep staging have been proposed for EOG and EMG sensors,  which aim to be more economical whilst producing similar performances to EEG electrodes (Virkkala  et al. 2007, 2008; Yetton et al. 2016). With respect to RBD detection, our previous work utilised  established objective techniques to evaluate REM sleep without atonia (RWSA) and demonstrated  how they could be improved using a combination of EMG metrics that incorporate sleep architecture \n(Cooray et al. 2018, 2019). We will investigate the inclusion of ECG based metrics that exploit changes in ANS, as a substitute or enhancement for RBD detection. Consequently, using a simplified combination of ECG, EOG and EMG sensors, this study explored the feasibility of simpler RBD screening, being minimalistic while proving as effective at identifying RBD compared to conventional full PSG techniques.  \n# 2.  Data\nPSG recordings used in this study were collected from several sources and included participants diagnosed with RBD and age-matched healthy controls (HCs), detailed in Table 1. The Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) cohort one (O\u2019Reilly et al. 2014) provided 53 HC individuals, where three were excluded due to their poor ECG signal fidelity (specifically, participants labelled SS01, SS10, and SS18). Clinically diagnosed participants with idiopathic RBD were collated from the Physionet Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) sleep database (22 RBD participants) (Goldberger et al. 2000; Terzano et al. 2001) and a private database of RBD participants from the John Radcliffe (JR) hospital (35 participants), Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Oxford. While the JR dataset included two nights of full PSG recordings for each participant, this study simply used the  second night, where available (only two participants had a single night recording). Eight participants from the CAP database were excluded because one was a duplicate recording (RBD11) and seven had secondary RBD, including five diagnosed with PD (RBD1, RBD2, RBD3, RBD7, and RBD9), one with multiple systems atrophy (RBD13), and one with Lewy body disease (RBD5). Consequently, this combined RBD cohort provided a total of 50 RBD participants, of which two were taking Clonazepam  to treat their condition, while ten participants were taking anti-depressants (Citalopram, Venlafaxine, Sertraline, Duloxetine, and Lorazepam) to treat REM sleep without atonia (RSWA). All RBD participants had an apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) of less than 7.1 and were evaluated as being mild and unremarkable, except for one participant (RBD1) from the CAP sleep database with a severe index of 30/h (previously excluded for secondary RBD). Five RBD participants with concurrent RBD and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) wore a continuous positive airway pressure ventilator at the time of their PSG recordings, which would benefit their AHI score. This study complied with the requirements of the Department of Health Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care 2005 and  was approved by the Oxford University hospitals NHS Trust (HH/RA/PID 11957). These two RBD datasets were combined to balance the HC recordings provided by the MASS database. Furthermore, this combination provides an opportunity to evaluate how generalizable this study is over differing  datasets annotated at different institutions. Once more by using openly available datasets (MASS and\nCAP), this study can be reproduced in combination with the toolbox provided at  https://github.com/navsnav/Minimal-RBD-Sleep-Detection.  Annotations of the PSG recordings were completed by experts using either the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) (Rechtschaffen and Kales 1968) or AASM guidelines (Iber et al. 2007). For the purposes of this study, these set of rules are easily converted to three stages (REM, NREM, and W), where NREM  is defined by S1, S2, S3, S4, N1, N2 or N3. To explore the most economical combination of sensors, the  following signals were analysed:  \u25cf 1 ECG (2 electrodes - Einthoven derivation)  \u25cf 1 EOG (2 electrodes \u2013 bipolar signal)  \u25cf 1 EMG (2 electrodes \u2013 submentalis)  Numerous studies have used limited sensors to assess automated sleep staging, but for this study we  applied automated sleep staging on healthy and RBD participants followed by automated RBD identification.  \nCAP), this study can be reproduced in combination with the toolbox provided at https://github.com/navsnav/Minimal-RBD-Sleep-Detection.

Method\n# 3.1  Pre-processing \nTo reduce the impact of noise and artefacts, PSG signals were pre-processed. Firstly, all ECG, EOG and EMG signals were resampled at 200Hz. The EOG signal was pre-processed with a 500th order band pass finite impulse response (FIR) filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.3Hz and 40Hz. The EMG signal was filtered with a 500th order notch filter at 50Hz and 60Hz (because the recordings were sourced from either Europe or Canada), in addition to a 500th order band pass FIR filter between 10Hz and 100Hz. The ECG signal was filtered by a 10th order Butterworth band pass filter between 5Hz and 45Hz.  \n# 3.2  Feature Extraction\nFeature extraction for EOG and EMG signals were as described in our previous study (Cooray et al. 2019), based on established literature in automated sleep staging (G\u00fcne\u015f et al. 2010; Koley and Dey 2012; Liang et al. 2012; Lajnef et al. 2015; Yetton et al. 2016). Literature that described ECG features for automated sleep staging provided motivation for this study (Redmond and Mcnicholas 2007; Mendez et al. 2010; Xiao et al. 2013; Ebrahimi et al. 2015; Fonseca et al. 2015; Yoon et al. 2017; Malik et al. 2018; Y\u00fccelba\u015f et al. 2018) and are summarised in Table 2. For this study the pre-processed ECG signal was segmented into five-minute epochs, often used for HRV analysis (Ebrahimi et al. 2015). Features were then derived after Pan-Tompkins QRS detection (Pan and Tompkins 1985) from each 30-second segment. These features were then averaged across a moving 150-second sliding window,\ndemonstrated in other similar studies (Redmond and Mcnicholas 2007; Xiao et al. 2013; Fonseca et al 2015).  \n# 3.3  Automated Sleep Stage Classification\nThe Random Forest (RF) algorithm (Breiman 2001) has proven effective for automated sleep staging and was used for this study. The classifier was trained to classify 30-second epochs into one of three sleep stages (REM, NREM and W) using a combination of 25 EOG features, 17 EMG features and 75 ECG features, as described in Table 2 (the number of trees was set to 500, \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66= \u221a\ud835\udc40 (rounded down) randomly selected features, where \ud835\udc40 is the total number of features (detailed in Table 4)). For each of the three sleep stages the classifiers were evaluated using macro-averaged sleep stage accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen-Kappa score (three stage) by using 10-subject-fold cross-validation with an even split between healthy and RBD participants. Additionally, multi-stage classification was assessed by Cohen\u2019s Kappa (Cohen 1960), a metric often used in sleep staging to evaluate the agreement between manual and automated annotations. These performances were compared to results obtained using EEG, EOG and EMG features described in Cooray et al (2019). Our previous work demonstrated that accurate automated sleep staging (especially REM detection) yielded a high performance in RBD detection. \n# 3.4  RBD Detection\nIn RBD diagnosis, literature stipulates that after the identification of REM sleep, RSWA must be confirmed visually (Sateia 2014). In our previous work we demonstrated that established features, which quantify RSWA in combination with sleep architecture, provided RBD detection performances approaching that of the gold standard (manual clinical diagnosis) by using RF classifiers (Cooray et al. 2018, 2019). This study emulated previous results and compared them to RBD detection using  additional ECG based metrics in isolation and combination with EMG based metrics through RF classification.   RF classifiers were used to achieve RBD detection, as per the combinations detailed in Table 5. Classifiers were trained using 500 trees; \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66= \u221a\ud835\udc40 (where M is the number of features detailed in Table 5), and evaluated using a 10-subject-fold cross-validation scheme. In addition to the features detailed in our previous study, we proposed new ECG features that capture changes in heart rate variability between sleep stages (see Table 3Error! Reference source not found.).   A summary of all ECG based metrics that incorporate sleep architecture and HRV in order to identify RBD are detailed in Table 3. Specifically, to quantify the variability, the mean sample entropy for each REM epoch was calculated for every participant. Similarly the standard deviation of the RR intervals\nfor every REM epoch was averaged for all participants. Often low frequency and high frequency  components of RR intervals are used to describe sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in the  autonomic nervous system, and as a result the mean peak low frequency and high frequency was  calculated for all participants. To capture the changes in heart rate variation between sleep stages,  the ratio between REM and NREM values was calculated for the mean RR interval. The low frequency  and high frequency ratio is a popular feature used in heart rate variability, and the ratio between  NREM and REM epochs was calculated for each participant as an RBD metric. Literature has also  suggested that PD is significantly comorbid with atrial fibrillation (AF) (Hong et al. 2019), consequently  the metrics termed irregular index and origin count (Sarkar et al. 2008; Oster and Clifford 2015) were  used to quantify irregularly irregular heartbeats during NREM and REM sleep. These ECG based  metrics were used to automatically identify RBD participants and were compared to metrics from our  previous studies (Cooray et al. 2018, 2019).   Furthermore the RBD detection performance for these metrics were evaluated using manually and  automatically annotated sleep staging using the best combination of minimal sensors (see Table 4), in  order to validate their use in an end-to-end RBD screening support tool. The impact of automated  sleep staging on the calculation of these metrics was also carefully analysed.    The fidelity and consistency of these ECG based metrics derived though manually and automatically  annotated sleep staging were evaluated by Bland and Altman (B&A) plots (Bland and Altman 1986,  1995, 1999). B&A plots were introduced to describe the agreement between two quantitative  measures as an improvement to simple correlation factors. While correlation factors provide the  strength of a linear relationship, they do not imply a good agreement between two methods. The B&A  plot measures agreement by plotting the mean against the difference of both quantitative methods  (Bland and Altman 1986), while constructing the limits of agreement (where Bland and Altman et al.  recommend that 95% of all data points fall within two standard deviations of the mean difference).  Furthermore, B&A plots detail the bias between the mean differences of both quantitative methods  and their significance. For this study B&A plots were used to establish a level of agreement between  RBD metrics, derived using manually and automatically annotated sleep stages within a certain  agreement interval. The decision on whether these intervals are acceptable must be decided by  clinical evaluation and in our case through the performance of automated RBD detection with metrics  derived from automated sleep staging.    \nThe following results are presented in three sections, detailing 1) automated sleep stage classification 2) RBD detection using automatically annotated sleep stages, and 3) Bland and Altman plots for RBD metrics using automatically/manually annotated sleep stages.   \n# 4.1  Automated Sleep Stage Classification\nThe best performance of automated sleep staging was provided by all three signals (EOG, ECG, and EMG) attaining an agreement score of 0.58 (0.70 and 0.48 for the individual HC and RBD cohort, respectively). These results are also comparable to our previous study that included EEG features (Cooray et al. 2019), shown in Figure 1 as combination Z3 (EEG, EOG, and EMG). Once again it is clear that the automated sleep staging performs considerably better on HC participants than RBD participants, echoing the results from our previous study (Cooray et al. 2019). The best performing combination of two sensors proved to be the EOG and EMG sensors (C2), followed by the EOG and ECG combination (A2) achieving a 0.57 and 0.51 agreement score, respectively. While combining ECG and EMG features attained an agreement score of 0.41. The best single sensor performance was given by EOG features (see Figure 1 B1), achieving a three-stage score of 0.50, considered moderate agreement (Landis and Koch 1977). The single ECG and EMG sensor (A1 and C1, respectively) had limited success, never exceeding fair agreement (0.30 and 0.28, respectively).    The ranked feature importance in REM detection are detailed in Figure 2, for (a) ECG features and for (b) combined EOG, ECG and EMG features. From Figure 2 (a) it appears elapsed time is the most important, followed by zero crossing interval (ZCI) and RR interval based features. In Figure 2 (b) EOG features dominate the list of important features, while EMG and ECG features make an appearance in the top 30.  \n# 4.2  RBD Detection with ECG Metrics\nThe performances of RBD detection by ECG and EMG metrics are depicted in Figure 3. ECG metrics proved they are able to distinguish RBD participants with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.62\u00b10.20, 0.56\u00b10.23, and 0.68\u00b10.24, respectively. The combination of EMG metrics and sleep architecture (detailed in our previous study) achieved an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.93\u00b10.09, 0.92\u00b10.13, and 0.94\u00b10.092, respectively. Combining EMG and ECG metrics for RBD detection provided a similar accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.93\u00b10.10, 0.94\u00b10.092, and 0.92\u00b10.13, respectively. \nThe ranking of ECG and/or EMG metrics for RBD detection are depicted in Figure 4.  Simply using ECG  metrics (Figure 4 (a)) indicated that NREM origin count (a measure or regular heart beats) and NREM  irregular index (IrrIndex, a measure of irregularly irregular heartbeats) and the ratio or NREM sleep  were the most valuable. Figure 4 (b) ranks EMG metrics, where the atonia index ratio (between NREM  and REM), atonia index (REM) and the fractal exponent ratio (between NREM and REM) proved to be  the most important. ECG and EMG metrics used in combination (Figure 4 (c)), demonstrated that EMG  metrics remain the best identifiers in a similar order to Figure 4 (b).   Figure 5 details the best RBD detection performance from automated sleep staging classifiers using a  combination of EOG, ECG and EMG features. The best performance (F1 score) was given by C2D2  (three sensors - EOG and EMG for sleep staging followed by EMG and ECG for RBD detection), followed  by C2E1 combination (two sensors - EOG and EMG for sleep staging followed by EMG for RBD  detection) with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1 score of 0.90\u00b10.11, 0.88\u00b10.13, 0.92\u00b10.098,  and 0.90\u00b10.12. These results are similar and only marginally less than when using a cumbersome EEG  combination (Cooray et al. 2019), depicted by Z3 (Figure 5). \nThe impact of RBD metrics calculated from automated sleep staging from a single EOG and EMG is  evaluated by the Bland-Altman plots given in Figure 6. A selection of important RBD metrics (provided by Figure 4) appear to provide agreeable results where the limits of agreement are represented by  horizontal dotted lines. The mean difference bias is defined by the solid black line in Figure 6, where of the top three EMG and ECG based metrics all appear to have a slight bias when using automated  sleep staging (shaded area around mean difference includes zero).  \n# 5.  Discussion\nThe aim of this study was to investigate a minimalistic approach for identifying RBD through a fully  automated pipeline. This study excluded the use of cumbersome-to-apply EEG sensors and instead  focused on a combination of ECG, EOG and EMG sensors to achieve automated three-stage sleep  classification and RBD identification. The use of EOG and EMG sensors for automated sleep staging  proved the most effective, achieving REM detection that was comparable with the literature and near  human expert annotation (Figure 1). Not surprising given visual staging (especially REM) relies heavily  on EOG and EMG signals. Furthermore this study validated the use of ECG based RBD metrics to  identify RBD using an RF classifier (Figure 3). Once more the performance of RBD detection remained  high when using automated sleep staging from EOG and EMG features (Figure 5 and Table 7). This can \nbe attributed to the high positive prediction value and specificity provided by the automated sleep  staging that facilitated congruent RBD metrics (Figure 6).   As has been established in literature, the inter-rater variability of manual sleep staging is high and is  exacerbated further by sleep disorders that provide additional variation in sleep characteristics  (Danker-Hopfe et al. 2004, 2009). This was also demonstrated in our previous study, where automated  sleep staging performed better on HCs than RBD participants (Cooray et al. 2019) and was again  observed in this study (for all combination of sensors). For a single ECG sensor, sleep staging was  particularly difficult for RBD participants.  The automated three-stage classification performance of ECG features (Table 6) on a combined  dataset (kappa of 0.30), reflected the lower range of results achieved by similar studies (kappa  between 0.35 and 0.73) (Redmond and Mcnicholas 2007; Xiao et al. 2013; Fonseca et al. 2015;  Y\u00fccelba\u015f et al. 2018). However these studies benefit from smaller datasets focusing on relatively  younger HCs (participants of 28 to 48 people with a mean age that varies from 41 to 43).  Y\u00fccelbas et  al. (2018) achieved the highest score of 0.74, but even this technique applied to another dataset  achieved a kappa of 0.43 and for participants with OSA scored between 0.52 and 0.57, indicating a  high degree of variability (Y\u00fccelba\u015f et al. 2018). Xiao et al. (2013) had the added benefit of using  manually annoated ECG segments, termed \u201cstationary\u201d, achieving a score of 0.47 (Xiao et al. 2013).   Interestingly, while this study acheives a kappa score of 0.30 (ECG features) on a mixed cohort of 100  participants, the RBD cohort severely underperforms with respect to REM detection. This was due to  a misclassification of REM states for NREM and wake, potentially caused by changes to HRV regulation  and from movement artefacts, which might be attributed to symptoms of RBD. The feature  importance for REM detection, detailed in Figure 2 (a), ranks elapsed-time as more indicative than  ECG features. Elapsed time is the progression of time since the beginnng of the first annoated epoch  from the PSG recording. This feature might benefit from the sleep technician that arbritarily starts  annotating sleep stages from a point they deem appropriate or around the time of lights off. While  this attribute might not be directly applicable to a fully automated take-home screening device, there  is the near equivalent arbitrary starting point determined by the sleep participant at around the time  of lights off. Participants often provide a signature to ensure synchronisation between recording  devices or simply to indicate lights off. The highest ranked ECG features included RR intervals and ZCI,  which are illustrative of HRV but ultimately these features do not contribute towards high REM  detection sensitivity.   Alternatively, EOG features provided a boost to automated sleep staging performance (kappa score  of 0.50 and mean REM F1 score of 0.52), as shown in Figure 1. These results are comparable to EOG \nsleep staging literature that achieved four-state kappa scores of 0.59 (Virkkala et al. 2008) and REM  F1 scores of 0.64-0.80 (Agarwal et al. 2005; Virkkala et al. 2008; Yetton et al. 2016). It is clearly evident  that for automated sleep staging, the ability of ECG features is superceded by EOG features.  Combining EMG and EOG features, further improved automated sleep staging with a kappa of 0.57  and mean REM F1 score of 0.62. Using all three sensors (EOG, EMG, and ECG) provided an almost  negligible improvement (kappa score of 0.58 and mean REM F1 score of 0.60). Essentially providing  no additional merit for an additional ECG sensor, which would only add cost and hassel to a potential  screening support tool. The inclusion of EEG features (Z3 combination, see Figure 1), as per our  previous study (Cooray et al. 2019), provided only a marginal improvement to REM detection, but  markedly improved three-stage kappa, due to improved NREM and wake classification (kappa score  of 0.72 and mean REM F1 score of 0.62).   The feature ranking for REM detection, when using all signals, are detailed in Figure 2 (b). The  prevalance of EOG features only confirms their correlation with REM sleep and specifically detecting  rapid eye movement through permutation entropy, max peak amplitude, and coastline features. In  the ranking order, these features are closely followed by elapsed time and EMG features that measure  muscle atonia (amplitude percentile, entropy, and relative power). The addition of ECG features did  not improve EOG, EMG or EOG and EMG combinations, indicating that these features are often  redundant and perhaps only help to reduce variation (see Figure 1). While ECG features did not appear  fruitful in automated sleep staging, they had some success in RBD detection.  RBD classification through ECG metrics proved effective but ultimately did not outperform EMG  metrics (see Figure 3). The ECG metric ranking for RBD detection ((a)) indicates that NREM origin count  and NREM irregular index as the most informative. Literature describes a loss in HRV regulation during  REM (Postuma et al. 2010; Sorensen et al. 2013; Bugalho et al. 2018) and differences in atrial  fibrillation (Hong et al. 2019) in individuals diagnosed with RBD. Combining EMG and ECG metics  provided a marginal improvement to RBD detection, with regards to the F1 score (Figure 3). This  suggests that ECG and EMG metrics are correlated, in that a reduction of HRV regulation during REM  is synonymous with a loss of muscle atonia. The impact of automated sleep staging on RBD detection  was also evaluated using the most successful combinations of sensors (detailed in Figure 1).   The performance of RBD detection using the best sensor combinations for both automated sleep  staging and RBD classification are detailed in Figure 5. The boost in performance from using more than  one sensor for sleep staging can be observed in C2E1, C2D2, and A3D2 (multiple sensors) compared  to B1D1, B1E1, and B1D2 (single EOG sensor). Previously our results confirmed that C2 and A3 provide  better REM detection sensitivity compared to B1 (Figure 1), thereby enabling better RBD detection \nthrough better REM classification. Interestingly, when using automated sleep staging (C2 \u2013 EOG and  EMG), RBD detection using ECG metrics (C2E1) are equivalent to EMG metrics (C2D2), see Figure 5.  Once again proving that there is considerable overlap in the discriminating abilities of both these  metrics, where performance can be differentiated with better REM detection. In terms of achieving  economy and efficiency, C2E1 used two sensors (EOG and EMG) compared to three for C2D2 and A3D2  (EOG, EMG and ECG), a potential advantage for a simple and cost-effective screening tool.  Furthermore these results are comparable to results derived using EEG features illustrated by the Z3E1  combination, thereby bypassing the complications of applying EEG electrodes.   From Table 7 we can observe the RBD detection results using manually and automatically annotated  sleep staging (using the minimalistic combination of a EMG and EOG sensor). While RBD detection  performance dropped slightly when using automated sleep staging, it still remained high (mean  accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.90, 0.88, and 0.92, respectively).    Bland-Altman analysis was used to evaluate the agreement between metric quantification using  manually and automatically annotated sleep staging from the C2 combination (EOG and EMG). Figure  6 (a)-(e) provides the Bland-Altman plots for the best metrics for RBD detection using the EMG sensor  (atonia index, fractal exponent, and atonia index ratio) and the ECG sensor (irregular index, RR interval  index ratio, and NREM origin count) as detailed in Figure 6. From these plots it is clear that automated  sleep staging (derived from EOG and EMG features) sufficiently produced RBD metrics that were  correlated to metrics derived from manually annotated sleep staging. However we can observe a bias  introduced to RBD metrics derived from automatically annotated sleep staging, where the mean  difference (solid black line in Figure 6) and its\u2019 confidence interval (grey shadded area) does not include  the line of equality (zero axis, dotted line through the origin). This is the direct result from automated  sleep stage misclassification. When REM is misclassifed for NREM and wake, the impact on the  calculation of RBD metrics provides a bias towards values ascociated with NREM and wake sleep.  Because automated sleep staging was poorest on RBD participants (red circles), we observed a greater  variation in the y-axis (difference), especially as the x-axis values (mean value) moved towards values  ascociated with RBD (red circles). Note that the limits of agreement are calculated by assuming that  the difference between the metrics calculated from manually and automatically annotated sleep  stages are normally distributed, however this isn\u2019t strictly necessary (Bland and Altman 1999). From  these plots we can observe the resilience and fidelity of these metrics using automated sleep staging  from the most successful combination of minimal PSG sensors (EOG and EMG).   These results validate a cost-effective and readily accessible take-home sleep device for RBD screening  purposes using only an EOG and EMG sensor. However, often epidemiological studies incur much \ngreater costs for logistical reasons and include additional sensors to optimise their collection of data and therefore include ECG and EEG sensors. Often wearable devices and general sleep recordings are plagued with inconsistent and intermittent signals, given the unpredictability and difficulty of selfadministered devices outside of a clinical setting. This study overcomes these issues and further supports retrospective and prospective studies by demonstrating the redundancy and ability of these sensors to function interchangeably for both automated sleep staging and RBD detection. \n# 6.  Limitations & Future Direction\nWhile this study included a high number of participants, its application in a clinical setting are limited because it simply focused on HC and RBD cohorts. A clinical application would demand greater resilience to a myriad of sleeping disorders and other population variations that could easily share confounding RBD attributes. These include periodic limb movement of sleep, OSA, parasomnias, and severe insomnia (very fragmented sleep), which should also be included and evaluated. While ECG metrics did not prove as effective in RBD detection as EMG metrics, there is still no clear indication of which characteristic manifests earlier in RBD participants, loss of REM atonia or loss of HRV regulation during sleep. The loss of HRV regulation might even provide an early bio-marker for RBD, and could potentially offer insight into the PD conversion of RBD participants, although literature exists that suggests there is currently no correlation for the latter (Postuma et al. 2010). This study also confirmed that successful REM detection is paramount to effective RBD detection and future work to improve automated REM detection would only prove beneficial. Advances in deep learning techniques are achieving promising results and may prove useful in this context (Supratak et al. 2017; Phan et al. 2019). Furthermore applying these tools on wearable data would be the next logical step forward towards validating a fully automated RBD detection pipeline.  \n7.  Conclusion\n# 7.  Conclusion\nThis study proved the feasibility of a fully automated pipeline for RBD detection using an EOG and  EMG sensor. This study achieved automated sleep staging comparable to manual annotation, which  translated to a high performance in RBD detection. Once more this study verified RBD detection  through ECG based metrics (NREM irregular index, RR interval index ratio and REM RR interval  standard deviation) were effective but did not out-perform EMG based metrics. Furthermore their use  in automated sleep staging provided very little benefit and may not be worth the additional sensor for  a minimalistic and economical RBD screening tool.  \nAgarwal R, Takeuchi T, Laroche S, Gotman J.
