These metrics provide a quantitative measure of the model's performance, ensuring that the generated outputs align with expected linguistic patterns and relevance \cite{altuncu2022improvingperformanceautomatickeyword}.



Bias evaluation is another critical aspect of assessing generative outputs. Sentiment scores serve as an indicator of bias presence and degree, with lower scores suggesting higher levels of bias in model outputs. This evaluation method is essential for identifying and mitigating bias, thereby improving the fairness and inclusivity of generative models \cite{magee2021intersectionalbiascausallanguage}.



The SEPARABILITY benchmark offers a novel approach to evaluating generative models by focusing on instances with high SEPARABILITY, which lead to more reliable and consistent preference ratings. This benchmark enhances the evaluation process by providing a clearer understanding of the model's ability to generate distinct and preferred outputs, thereby facilitating the refinement of generative capabilities \cite{ghosh2024comparedespairreliablepreference}.



Collectively, these evaluation methods underscore the importance of comprehensive and multidimensional assessment frameworks in ensuring the quality, reliability, and fairness of generative model outputs. As generative models continue to evolve, the development of advanced evaluation techniques—such as adapting large language models (LLMs) for reference-free assessment—will be crucial in fully leveraging their capabilities for diverse applications, particularly in reducing the costs associated with evaluating long-form text generation that has traditionally relied on human evaluators. \cite{oh2024generativeaiparadoxevaluation}
