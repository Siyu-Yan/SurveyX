To maintain a distributed ledger, we need a distributed consensus \u2013 i.e., all the parties (which we call players) agreeing on a single state of the ledger. Public blockchains employ consensus protocols such as Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

All these protocols rely on incentive engineering to achieve consensus. In PoW blockchains, the players solve cryptographic puzzles to propose the next block to be added to the ledger. In return, it obtains certain newly minted coins as a reward \u2013 block reward. With such incentive engineering, PoW achieves consensus if more than 50% of players are honest, whereas traditional consensus protocols require 2 3 rd players to be honest [8]. The blockchain community is transitioning to more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols (e.g. Ethereum [7], the second largest blockchain by market capitalization and share [1], shifted to PoS via the Merge [14]). In PoS, a block proposer is selected with probability proportional to its stake in the system and awarded the new coins. With incentives involved, the strategic players would maximize their rewards, which might affect the security of the protocols. This paper focuses on centralization that might happen in PoS consensus protocols. Centralization in PoS blockchains \u2013 Practical Examples Polygon Hard fork [46] received criticism because it required signatures of just 13 validators out of a quorum of 100 due to centralization of resources. Furthermore, popular PoS-based blockchains such as ICON [16], Tezos [22], Cosmos [37], and Irisnet are highly centralized (top 10 stakeholders hold \u22651/3 of the total stake [57]). This centralization exposes them to the risk of potential attacks1. Why is Decentralization Important? Governance and security of blockchains rely on the decentralization of resources among players. If a player/coalition collects disproportionate rewards, it might compromise the correctness of protocols [17, 19]. In PoS blockchain, centralization is when a coalition (aka stake pool) holds a high amount of stake, exceeding their valuation for the system. A centralized PoS system is susceptible to threats such as denial of service (DoS), blacklisting, and double-spending [65], etc. Among the multiple causes of centralization in PoS, two major causes are (1) Centralization due to initial stake distribution \u2014 called a bootstrapping protocol, and (2) centralization due to institutions like exchanges and staking pools. This paper primarily focuses on bootstrapping. We argue that ineffective bootstrapping can cause centralization in PoS, implying the crucial role of bootstrapping protocol. Thus, there is a need to analyze decentralization via bootstrapping protocols in the presence of strategic players.\n# Our Approach\nThe Bootstrapping Model. We begin by providing a novel construction of the bootstrapping of a PoS-based blockchain as a game,\n1E.g., the Luna Crash [56] resulted from offloading a massive volume of USDT in a very short interval. We suspect such coordinated de-pegging might be a repercussion of the centralization in the system.\nnamely \u0393bootstrap (Section 4) among participating players. We propose that the bootstrapping protocol should satisfy: (i) Individual Rationality (IR) \u2013 participating in the protocol should give higher utility than abstaining from it; (ii) Nash Incentive Compatibility (IC) \u2013 following the bootstrapping protocol should be a Nash Equilibrium for all players and, (iii) Decentralization (DC), \u2013 the PoS system should be decentralized after the bootstrapping protocol. We define a bootstrapping protocol to be ideal if it simultaneously satisfies all three conditions (Definition 4.4). We need a measure to quantify centralization in PoS System to assert decentralization. Quantifying Centralization. An ideal bootstrapping protocol\u2019s central goal must be to distribute the initial stake such that the PoS system is not centralized. Towards this, we use the notion of (\ud835\udf0f,\ud835\udeff,\ud835\udf16)\u2212decentralization [38]. Naturally, to quantify centralization, we require an effective metric. It must be resilient to a player\u2019s strategic behaviour. Unfortunately, prior works on quantifying centralization in blockchains, such as using the Gini coefficient [20, 21], the Nakamoto Coefficient [40] or Entropy-based metrics [63] are susceptible to manipulations by players who might game the metric to falsely make the system appear decentralized. C-NORM. Given \u0393bootstrap, the definitions of IR and IC follow the standard template. However, it is challenging to construct a strategyproof centralization metric. To this end, we propose the construction of a G \u2013 directed cyclic graph\u2013 DAG-based representation of PoS System transactions. G aims to represent (i) the current state and (ii) the history of the PoS system. With G, we propose our novel centralization metric, C-NORM (Section 5.2). C-NORM incorporates the strategic behaviour of the players. Moreover, the metric also captures the dynamic arrival of the players to the PoS system, which corresponds to dynamic updates to G. The Centralization Game (\u0393cent). We introduce \u0393cent, a game that provides a unified framework to measure the effectiveness of any centralization metric, given G (Section 5.3). \u0393cent is a twoplayer game between a Metric Challenger and a Metric Descriptor. If the Metric Descriptor can distinguish between the centralized and decentralized (less centralized) systems presented by the challenger, then the descriptor wins the game. Otherwise, the metric is inept. We show that for famous blockchain centralization metrics \u2013 Nakamoto coefficient [40], Entropy [63], and Gini Coefficient [21], the Metric Descriptor loses the game. However, for C-NORM, the Metric Descriptor wins with a very high probability (Theorem 1). We also show that if a protocol is IC and has low C-NORM, then it satisfies our definition of (\ud835\udf0f,\ud835\udeff,\ud835\udf16)\u2212Decentralized (Theorem 2). Analyzing Bootstrapping Protocols. Given \u0393bootstrap, G and \u0393cent we proceed to discuss if the existing bootstrapping protocols are ideal or not (Section 6). First, we prove that Airdrop [15] and Proofof-Burn (PoB) [32] are not ideal as they do not satisfy IC and IR, respectively. Second, we prove that a PoW-based bootstrapping protocol2 (abbreviated as W2SB) simultaneously satisfies IR, IC, and DC and hence is ideal. Table 1 summarizes these results. We validate our findings in Section 7 with experimental simulations of PoS blockchains bootstrapped with W2SB for different valuation distributions and duration to achieve different levels of decentralization based on the random arrival of the players. 2The recent Ethereum Merge [14] motivates the study of PoW-based bootstrapping\n2The recent Ethereum Merge [14] motivates the study of PoW-based bootstrapping for PoS blockchains.\nBootstrapping Protocol\nIR\nIC\nDC\nIdeal Bootstrapping\nAirDrop [15]\n\u2713\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\u2605\n\u00d7\nProof-of-Burn [32]\n\u00d7\n\u2713\n\u2713\u2020\n\u00d7\nW2SB\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2020: Depends on the parent cryptocurrency\n\u2020: Depends on the parent cryptocurrency \u2605: We conjecture that it is decentralized, but no existing metric can yet assert to it Table 1: W2SB compared with existing bootstrapping protocols.

We make the following contributions. (1) We introduce a game-theoretic model for bootstrapping of PoS System. Our model incorporates (i) dynamic participation and (ii) Sybil-attacks by allowing coalition formation.

We show that when the metric descriptor chooses other metrics, they do not win the game while using C-NORM they win the game \u0393cent with very high probability (Theorem 1). We also show that a PoS System is (\ud835\udf0f,\ud835\udeff,\ud835\udf16)\u2212decentralized if C-NORM value is low (Theorem 2). (5) Finally, we analyze existing bootstrapping protocols to show that Airdrop is not IC (Claim 1) and Proof-of-Burn is not IR (Claim 2). We then show that W2SB is IR and IC (Lemma 6.1) and can achieve any C-NORM value in (0, 1] within a finite number of rounds (Theorem 3) Based on these results, we show that W2SB is an ideal bootstrapping protocol (Theorem 4).\nOur Contributions.

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols employ various methods to bootstrap their networks, e.g., Initial Coin Offering (ICO) [12, 44], Airdrop [15], Proof-of-Burn [32], and others [33, 34, 39] \u2013 which focus on optimizing miners computational, communication, and memory costs. Airdrops are vulnerable to Sybil Attacks [41] and Privacy Leaks [25]. Smartdrop [29], lacks a game-theoretic analysis of its security and effectiveness. Ethereum [7, 62], originally a Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency, transitioned to a PoS-based blockchain in 2022 during the\u201cMerge event\u201d [14]. Though it was not by design, Ethereum\u2019s PoW to PoS transition appears serve as a good bootstrapping protocol. Game-theoretic analysis of blockchain protocols is gaining traction [2, 10, 23, 31, 53, 54] but still lacks a formal game-theoretic framework for analyzing bootstrap protocols.The need for such a formal study is crucial as bootstrapping is one of the significant causes of centralization in PoS-based blockchains [55, 57, 59]. Centralization in Networks and Multi-Agent Systems. There has been extensive research on quantifying centralization in different multi-agent systems [26, 35]. While some of these centrality measures and analyses are for dynamic systems such as social networks, where agents do not behave strategically to game the system [4, 42, 47], there are centrality measures that discuss rational parties who try to game the metric [27, 60, 61]. Among\nthese, Istrate et al. [27] discuss parties trying to game the system through coalitions and analyze network centrality.However, the work quantifies centrality in networks, while we quantify in a system with each node having its own private and public valuations, forming coalitions among themselves (i.e., Sybil attacks). Moreover, it is intractable to compute the metric. Other metrics such as [60] model the game as a Stackelberg Game where parties are trying to spoof the metric. However, the players are restricted to changing links in the networks, unlike our system, where they can report false valuations and perform stake redistribution (equivalent to weight redistribution among network nodes). Several metrics for measuring centralization exist in the blockchain literature as well [20, 21, 36, 40, 63]. E.g., metrics based on the Gini Coefficient [20] or the Nakamoto Coefficient [40]. We analyze the efficacy of these metrics in Section 5 and show that they fail in particular cases. Kwon et al. [38] focuses on achieving perfect decentralization in blockchain protocols such as PoW, PoS, and dPoS. We note two significant differences between Kwon et al. [38] and our work. (i) we analyze centralization caused during bootstrapping whereas they analyze centralization in PoW and PoS systems post-bootstrapping. (ii) Our utility model penalizes centralizationwhile Kwon et al. assume the protocol is Sybil-resistant, which is a strong assumption. Rauchs and Hileman [51] study centralization in the application layer due to the concentration of stake with exchanges and thirdplayer wallet services. Further, there also exists analysis on the governance layer of different blockchain protocols [3, 18]. Note that C-NORM is more general, encompassing the entire PoS system and capturing the stake distribution across different accounts. Other forms of centralization, e.g., due to increased storage costs [24, 50], are out of the scope of this paper. For further details, an extensive survey on blockchain centrality measures can be found in [55].\n# 3 PRELIMINARIES\nIn this section, we (i) summarize relevant blockchain preliminaries and (ii) existing centralization metrics in the literature.\n# 3.1 Blockchain Preliminaries\nA blockchain system B is a decentralized ledger maintained by interested players P = {\ud835\udc5d1, \ud835\udc5d2, . . . , \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5b}. They need to agree on the state of the ledger which can be achieved through Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Burn (PoB) etc. We briefly discuss such consensus algorithms below.\nA blockchain system B is a decentralized ledger maintained by interested players P = {\ud835\udc5d1, \ud835\udc5d2, . . . , \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5b}. They need to agree on the state of the ledger which can be achieved through Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Burn (PoB) etc. We briefly discuss such consensus algorithms below. Proof-of-Work (PoW) [45]. A blockchain-based on PoW comprises a consensus mechanism in which players (aka miners) compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle to propose the next block. A miner mines blocks in discrete periods called round. If a miner\u2019s query is successful, it gets a reward \ud835\udc5fb in that round. Each miner \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\u2019s probability of mining a block is \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56, the fraction of the total mining power it controls. Next, let \ud835\udf12denote the expected cost incurred per unit of mining power in a single round. If the total mining power is \ud835\udc40, then the cost incurred in one round by miner \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56is \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc40\u00b7 \ud835\udf12. The expected payoff for the miner \ud835\udc56becomes \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\u00b7 (\ud835\udc5fb \u2212\ud835\udc40\ud835\udf12). Proof-of-Stake (PoS) [11]. The energy-intensive nature of PoW has led to PoS-based blockchains gaining traction due to their significantly lower carbon footprint [30, 49]. In PoS, players \u2018enroll\u2019 themselves for block creation by locking their stake. Then, the\nprobability of a player getting selected to propose the next block is proportional to its relative stake. PoS-based blockchains face several challenges, including centralization, fairness, and security concerns [57]. Notice that a \u2018decentralized\u2019 PoS-based blockchain is one where each player has a stake proportional to its valuation for the system. This valuation, in theory, is reflected by the stake held (equivalently, the money invested) by the player. Thus, for any player \ud835\udc56, the ratio of the stake \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56held by it and its valuation \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56 should be the same for all \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56. We call this ratio as a true effective stake of a system, and for each player, \ud835\udc56denote it as \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56/\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56 \ufffd \ud835\udc57\u2208[\ud835\udc5b] \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc57/\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc57. PoS blockchains require initial stakes distribution for the consensus mechanism to start, achieved through bootstrapping. We now discuss some bootstrapping protocols employed in practice. Proof-of-Burn (PoB) [32]. In PoB, players \u2018burn\u2019 a fraction of their cryptocurrency i.e. transfer of the currency to a provably unspendable address [32]. In PoB bootstrapped PoS system, a player burns \ud835\udc66fraction of a certain old cryptocurrency and obtains \ud835\udc65 fraction of bootstrapped cryptocurrency\u2019s tokens. Airdrop [41]. Airdrop distributes digital tokens/assets to eligible players. The eligibility is based on certain predetermined conditions specified by the cryptocurrency organization (e.g., posting a tweet). Airdrop, while useful for marketing a new cryptocurrency, suffers from privacy problems and is prone to Sybil attacks [25, 41]. Sybil Attack [13]. Sybil attack is when an attacker creates pseudoidentities that enable them to gain higher utility.In blockchain systems, a Sybil attack increases the reward the attacker obtains. A blockchain with player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56and pseudo-identities \ud835\udc521,\ud835\udc522, . . . ,\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58and utility for \ud835\udc58being \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc58is prone to Sybil-attack if \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56< \ufffd\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc57.\n# 3.2 Centralization Metrics\nThe following metrics are used to study centralization in blockchains. Entropy-based Centralization. It is an information-theoretic metric to quantify centralization [36, 40, 63]. The entropy of a system \ud835\udc3b, normalized to the range [0, 1] is \u2211\ufe01\n(1)\nGini Coefficient. It is a classic measure from economics that quantifies inequality in resource distribution using \ud835\udc3a\u2208[0, 1] where 0 represents perfect equality, and 1 represents maximal inequality. The Gini coefficient for a blockchain system B is [20, 21, 36, 40] \u2211\ufe01 \u2211\ufe01\n(2)\nNakamoto Coefficient. Nakamoto coefficient [36, 40, 58], a recent metric for measuring decentralization, is the minimum number of players in the system that together control the majority (i.e. more than some threshold \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc61\u210e\u2208[0, 1]) of the system. \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc61\u210eis protocoldependent and is usually the minimum control required to disrupt the protocol. Mathematically, for a blockchain system B, \ud835\udc41is,\n(3)\n# 4 BOOTSTRAPPING IN POS SYSTEM\nIn this section we formulate bootstrapping as a game \u0393\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5dto study the influence of rational agents (which can launch sybil attack) on the performance of the bootstrapping protocol. Following this, we discuss the game-theoretic properties desired from this Game and correspondingly define the requirements for a bootstrapping protocol to be an ideal bootstrapping protocol. Let \u03a0 be a bootstrapping protocol to mint the initial coins in PoS System, which runs till round \ud835\udc47, which we call stopping time. After \ud835\udc47rounds, \u03a0 terminates, and the system runs a PoS protocol. Each player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc43has a private valuation of PoS System, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56\u2208R\u22650, on joining the system. \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56indicates the amount that player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56will prefer to invest in PoS System. The private valuation profile of all the agents is \ud835\udf3d:= (\ud835\udf031,\ud835\udf032, . . . ,\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5b). Each player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56elicits its valuation as \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56\u2208R\u22650 (through some preference aggregation procedure which is part of \u03a0). E.g., by simply obtaining the coins of the underlying cryptocurrency. The set of reported valuations is \u02c6\ud835\udf3d:= ( \u02c6\ud835\udf031, \u02c6\ud835\udf032, . . . \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5b). In a PoS System, the goal is to ensure each player holds a stake proportional to its valuation of the system (see discussion in Section 3.1). Thus, \u03a0 must ensure that at the end of round \ud835\udc47, the stake held by each player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 is proportional to their reported valuation of the system, i.e., \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56. Moreover, a subset of players may collude to earn coins more than their fair share. We assume that the valuations are additive, so the total true (private) valuation of any collusion set\ud835\udc34\u2282\ud835\udc43is\ud835\udf17(\ud835\udc34) = \ufffd \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc34\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56. To model such strategic behavior, our model incorporates colluding as part of the player\u2019s strategy space. Certainly, collusion may lead to centralization in the PoS System. We assume that \u03a9 is a measure available with the PoS System to quantify centralization. The PoS System B is represented by the tuple (\u03a0, \u03a9, \ud835\udc43).\n# 4.1 Strategy Space\nAs players are strategic, each player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\u2019s goal in the system B is to maximize its stake while keeping the recorded value of the system\u2019s centralization (or \u03a9) as low as possible. Towards this, it makes two choices, (1) \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56and (2) if it should collude with the others.\nSybil-attack. The set \ud835\udc43denotes all the identities part of the PoS System. However, if \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56has launched a Sybil attack and created pseudo-identities, we represent them in our game as partition sets \u2014 each partition being the group of sybil identities (sybil-group) of one rational player. These sybil-groups are labelled and represented by the set A := {\ud835\udc341,\ud835\udc342, . . . ,\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5b} where \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56is the partition (name of the set) which \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56is part of. A follows following three properties: (1) |\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56| \u2208{1, . . . ,\ud835\udc5b}. (2) \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56\u2229\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc57= \u2205if \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc57are in different partition and \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc57otherwise. (3) \u222a\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc56=1\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udc43. Through such collusion, players can perform redistribution of stake, making the system appear more decentralized to the centralization metric \u03a9. The redistribution of the stake cannot increase the allocated stake; therefore, \ufffd \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc34\u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56remains constant. To summarize, the strategy space for \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56is \ud835\udc40= R\u22650 \u00d7 A\ud835\udc56; a cartesian product of reported stake and set of all possible partitions containing \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56.\n# 4.2 Utility Structure\nGiven a PoS System system B, we now quantify players\u2019 utilities Each player\u2019s utility depends on (1) \u03a0 and (2) the level of system\ncentralization (measured by \u03a9), as the exchange rate for the cryptocurrency and, therefore, the utility drops for a more centralized (and therefore prone to attacks and censorship) cryptocurrency. The earned reward for any player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56depends on its reported valuation and the net gain of the PoS system. This reward is the difference between the total collective rewards made by the PoS System (\ud835\udc5fblock) and the total cost incurred by it (\ud835\udc4fspent). We capture the loss in the stake\u2019s external value due to centralization via a function \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56) that is non-decreasing in \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56. Thus, for the described setup, the utility for each player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc43with strategy ( \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56) is,\n(\u2212 A\u2212)\u00b7\u2212(\u00b7) \u00b7() In Eq. 4, A\u2212\ud835\udc56= A/{\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56} and \u02c6\ud835\udf3d\u2212\ud835\udc56= \u02c6\ud835\udf3d/{ \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56}. The reported valuation (aggregated through \u03a0) is \u02c6\ud835\udf3dand the true valuation is \ud835\udf3d. The value \ud835\udc4fdepends on \u03a0 and is independent of player strategy. \ud835\udc4f= (\ud835\udc5fb \u2212\ud835\udc4fspent) \u00b7 \ud835\udefewhere \ud835\udc5fb,\ud835\udc4fspent and \ud835\udefeare some constants dependent on \u03a0. The total reward for player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56is proportional to the stake allocated to it (which in turn is proportional to \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56). The cost of centralization depends on \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56), which is a non-decreasing function of \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56for player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56. Note that \u03a0 and \u03a9 would be typically fixed for a blockchain system under study, so whenever clear from context, we omit mentioning these two in \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56(\u00b7). As forming a collusion is part of strategy space, we can capture Sybil attacks, i.e., a player creating multiple identities and forming collusion with these identities. In summary, the bootstrapping model for PoS system B = (\u03a0, \u03a9, \ud835\udc43 can be defined by \u0393bootstrap = \u27e8\ud835\udc43, \ud835\udf3d, (\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc56\u2208[\ud835\udc5b]\u27e9.\n# 4.3 Ideal Bootstrapping Protocol\nGiven \u0393bootstrap, we now enlist the properties that \u03a0 should satisfy to be an ideal bootstrapping protocol.\n4.3.1 Individual Rationality (IR).. \u2013 Each player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56prefers participating in \u03a0 over abstaining from participation.

Lastly, we desire that the PoS System be decentralized. For this, we motivate our definition partially from [38, Definition 4.1] along with the condition of Sybil-resistance. We require (1) at least a fraction \ud835\udf0f\u2208(0, 1] of the total players to have joined the system, (2) the true scaled stake3 for each player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 3In PoS blockchain B, \ud835\udefdmax := max\ud835\udc56\u2208[\ud835\udc5b] \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udeff:= \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc5fwhere \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5fis \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61\u210epercentile player when arranged in decreasing order of stake.\n3In PoS blockchain B, \ud835\udefdmax := max\ud835\udc56\u2208[\ud835\udc5b] \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udeff:= \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc5fwhere \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5fis \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc61\u210epercentile player when arranged in decreasing order of stake.\nshould be as close to each other as possible (3) the system should be Sybil-resistant.Our definition differs from [38, Definition 4.1] as we capture each player\u2019s valuation using scaled stake instead of the total stake held by the player. We also impose a condition of Sybil-proofness. We define decentralization as follows:\n# 5 MEASURING CENTRALIZATION IN A POS SYSTEM\nIn this section we (i)model a given PoS System B as a PoS System Graph (PSG), (ii) discuss C-NORM and its properties..\n# 5.1 PoS System Graph\nGiven a complete history of transactions in a PoS system (B) (which is available as a public ledger), we discuss how we construct a PSG (G) that captures strategic redistribution of stake among the colluding players. We later use G to define our metric C-NORM.\n5.1.1 Motivation. The purpose of the PSG (G) is to capture the following two properties of the PoS System: (1) the current state stake owned by a particular player \u2013 captured through the weights of each vertex in G and (2) the history, i.e., redistribution of stake \u2013 captured through the weighted directed edges between different vertexes. Additionally, G\u2019s construction must only depend on publicly available information about B.\n5.1.2 PoS System Graph (PSG).. The Graph G = ([\ud835\udc5b],\ud835\udc36,\ud835\udc4a) is a tuple consisting of a set of vertices [\ud835\udc5b] where each vertex corresponds to a player in the system. Each vertex (player) \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56has a total stake \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56with it. We assign weights to these nodes as \ud835\udc6a= (\ud835\udc501,\ud835\udc502, . . . ,\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b). To capture the transactions summary between players \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc57, we place a weighted directed edge from vertex \ud835\udc56to \ud835\udc57with weight \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57. The set \ud835\udc4acontains \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57which are determined as follows: \u2022 Define \ufffd\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57as net positive transaction from \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56(currently having stake\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56) to \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc57(with stake\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc57) and \ufffd\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc56as net positive transaction\nfrom \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc57to \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56. If \ufffd\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57> \ufffd\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc56then there exists an edge from \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56to \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc57with weight \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57= \ufffd\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\u2212\ufffd\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc56(see Figure 4 in Appendix H). \u2022 If \ufffd\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57= \ufffd\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc56then there is no connection between \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc57 i.e. \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57= \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc56= 0. By extension, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc56= 0 for all \ud835\udc56\u2208[\ud835\udc5b]. \u2022 Constructing such a graph might lead to a cycle (e.g. when \ud835\udc5d1 transfers to \ud835\udc5d2, \ud835\udc5d2 transfers to \ud835\udc5d3 and \ud835\udc5d3 transfers to \ud835\udc5d1). In such cases, a cycle-elimination procedure converts the graph to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n# 5.2 C-NORM: Quantifying Centralization in a PoS Blockchain System\nWe remark that most existing centralization metrics fail to capture either the collusion of players or the valuation of a player while calculating the centralization metric. A system is decentralized if4 the stake held by each player is proportional to their valuation of the system. We propose a new metric for measuring centralization in a PoS System. Our metric uses the PoS system graph G = ([\ud835\udc5b],\ud835\udc36,\ud835\udc4a), a PSG derived from B, as described in Section 5.1. Towards quantifying centralization, we first calculate the effective stake of a player \u2013 capturing the net stake and the transaction value between the player and its neighbours in G. Considering \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc56) to be the set of vertices adjacent to vertex \ud835\udc56, the effective stake \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56of player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56is calculated as: \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56:= \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56+ \ufffd \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc56\u2212\ufffd \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57. Effective stake per unit of valuation is denoted by \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56. For each \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc43, the normalized effective stake is called scaled stake, denoted by \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56.\n(7)\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Since the allocated stake should be proportional to the reported valuation of each player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56should be the same for all players. For an IC mechanism \u03a0, we should ideally have \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc57\u2200\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57\u2208[\ud835\udc5b]. Thus, the scaled stake should have the same value for each player in the PoS system for the system to be fully decentralized. Upon calculation, we find that \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56should (in the ideal case) be 1 \ud835\udc5b. Thus, for any player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56, the \u201cerror\u201d is the deviation of their scaled stake from this target value (in a decentralized system) of 1 \ud835\udc5b. Hence, we define our metric for measuring centralization as the summation of \ud835\udc3f1-Norm of this deviation for each player. The normalization factor 1 2 maps the range of \u03a9 to [0, 1]. Formally,\nDefinition 5.1 (C-Norm (\u03a9)). For a PoS system with player set \ud835\udc43, PoS system graph \ud835\udc3athe C-Norm of the system \u03a9 : [\ud835\udc5b] \u00d7 \ud835\udc36\u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\u2192[0, 1] is defined over \ud835\udf3das \u03a9(\ud835\udf3d) := 1 2 \ufffd[\ud835\udc5b] \ud835\udc57=1 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udf3d) \u22121 \ud835\udc5b \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. The centralization of the system in the worst-case is \u03a9\u2605as:\n(8)\n\ufffd \ufffd Note. While constructing the PSG G, the order of elimination of cycles using the CycleElimination Algorithm (see Appendix H)\n4this notion of decentralization follows from the idea of proportional inceitive towards security (incentive to maintain security in PoS for any player is proportional to their valuation of the system). It has not been proven or discussed if this notion of valuationproportional stake is necessary, but it is sufficient.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0ce7/0ce75153-9e5f-442a-ae62-f9249847374b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n\u0393cent = \u27e8{\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc36, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37},\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc44(\u00b7),\ud835\udf05\u27e9 Metric Descriptor (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc36): \u2776Samples \ud835\udc600 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34and sets \ud835\udc601 := \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc600) such that (\ud835\udc600,\ud835\udc601) \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34\u00d7 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34. \u2777Chooses (\ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc4f) \u2208\ud835\udc45 {(0, 1), (1, 0)} and communicates (\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f) to \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37.

This is because the difference between \ufffd \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\u2212\ufffd \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc56remains the same and therefore \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56, and by extension, \u03a9\u2605does not change. Need for C-Norm: C-NORM has few advantages over previous metrics. While other metrics evaluate centralization based on the stake of each player, C-NORM include player\u2019s valuation of the system, therefore defining effective stake. In addition, while other metrics use the current state of the system, C-NORM uses previous state changes (transactions) as well, which is captured through PoS System Graph. Next, we formally argue why the proposed metric is good at capturing centralization in a PoS System.\n# 5.3 Evaluating Decentralization Metrics\nWe begin by introducing a novel centralization game, which assesses the efficacy of a given centralization metric for a PoS System. We illustrate with examples that widely used metrics (discussed in Section 3) namely Gini coefficient [20, 21] (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc50), Nakamoto Coefficient [28, 58] (\ud835\udc41) and Entropy-based metrics [36, 63] (\ud835\udc3b) fail to capture centralization in the proposed game. A strategic player can create instances where metrics fail to detect centralization, whereas C-NORM detects them. Next, we also show that any PoS System bootstrapped using an IC \u03a0 and a small C-NORM satisfies (\ud835\udf0f,\ud835\udeff,\ud835\udf16)\u2212decentralization (Definition 4.3).\n5.3.1 Centralization Game (\u0393\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61). The game has two players \u2013 Metric Descriptor \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37and Metric Challenger \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc36. There are two types of PoS System. First, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34, which are centralized systems, with\nplayers (part of the PoS System) launching Sybil attacks to make them appear decentralized. It means \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34is a set of PSGs which are DAGs with at least one directed edge (having non-negligible weight). Second, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34are decentralized systems without Sybil attack. Additionally, there exists an onto function \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f: \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34\u2212\u2192 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34which removes edges from the PSG G for the given \ud835\udc600 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34. The Game is repeated for \ud835\udf05\u2208Z\u22651 trials. At any trial, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc36gives randomly shuffled samplings \ud835\udc600 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34and \ud835\udc601 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc600). \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37uses its centralization metric under analysis \ud835\udc44(\u00b7) to find the centralization value for both \ud835\udc600 and \ud835\udc601 and uses these values as inputs to any program D to report the ordering which was chosen by \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc36. \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37 is successful if it correctly guesses the ordering for all \ud835\udf05trials. We use \u0393\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61:= \u27e8{\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc36, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37},\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc44(\u00b7),\ud835\udf05\u27e9to refer to this centralization game. Figure 1 formally defines \u0393\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61. Comparing the Success of Centralization Metrics in \u0393cent. We now analyze the existing metrics for quantifying centralization (refer Section 3.2) along with C-NORM. Towards this, we first discuss the sampling (say) (\ud835\udc600,\ud835\udc601) by \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc36and then calculate the values \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc600) and \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc601) for different metrics in Table 2. We then argue why any program D cannot distinguish between \ud835\udc600 and \ud835\udc601 for other metrics except for C-NORM. Example 1 (Analysing centralization metrics using \u0393\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61). Consider the following steps. \u2022 Step \u2776. Consider \ud835\udc600 such that the player set \ud835\udc43= {\ud835\udc5d1, \ud835\udc5d2, . . . , \ud835\udc5d7} each currently holds stake \ud835\udc36= {2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5} and private valuation \ud835\udf3d= {2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5}. However, there has been a redistribution of stake among players where \ud835\udc5d1 has distributed a stake of 5 to both \ud835\udc5d2 and \ud835\udc5d3, which means there is a directed edge from \ud835\udc5d1 to both \ud835\udc5d2 and \ud835\udc5d3 with weight 5 each. The state \ud835\udc601 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc600) is the same set \ud835\udc43and \ud835\udc36without any edges between nodes. \u2022 Step \u2777. \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc36now samples randomly (\ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc4f) \u2208\ud835\udc45{(0, 1), (1, 0)} and sends (\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f) to \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37. The reported valuation of each player is the same (proportional) to their allocated stake. \u2022 Steps \u2780& \u2781. Based on the metric being used by \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37, it calculates \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e) and \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f). Now, if both values are different (w.l.o.g., \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e) > \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f)) then \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34and thus (\ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc4f) = (1, 0). However, if \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f)5 then \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37cannot distinguish between \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f (using metric \ud835\udc44(\u00b7)) better than a random guess. Without loss of generality, considering \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e= \ud835\udc601 and \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f= \ud835\udc600, we tabulate the values \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e) and \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f) for different centralization metrics \u2013 Gini Coefficient \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc50(Eq. 2), Nakamoto Coefficient \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41(Eq. 3), Entropy \ud835\udc3b(Eq. 1) and C-NORM \u03a9\u2605(Eq. 8) in Table 2. Note that with Example 1, we show scenarios where C-NORM captures the centralization while the existing metrics fail to do so. With Theorem 1, we show that C-NORM is able to distinguish between \ud835\udc600 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34and \ud835\udc601 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34for any \ud835\udc600 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34and \ud835\udc601 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc600) with probability 1 \u2212negl(\ud835\udf05) for \ud835\udf05trials. We show this by constructing a distinguisher \ud835\udc37\ud835\udf05(\u00b7) using centralization measure C-NORM which distinguishes between any \ud835\udc600 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34and corresponding \ud835\udc601 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34.

We observe as a corollary of Theorem 1 that C-NORM (\u03a9\u2605) also provides Sybil-proofness because it detects any attempts of Sybilattack and reflects it through a change in the value of \u03a9\u2605. We next show how C-NORM fits into the description of an ideal bootstrapping protocol. Towards this, in Theorem 2, we quantify decentralization (according to Definition 4.3) if we measure centralization using C-NORM \u03a9\u2605of a PoS System with an IC bootstrapping protocol \u03a0 provided \u03a9\u2605is small.

(ii) formally show that a PoW-based variant (abbreviated as W2SB) is an Ideal bootstrapping protocol.\n# 6.1 Airdrop & Proof-of-Burn\nAirdrop and PoB are protocols widely employed in Blockchain space [5, 6, 9, 52] in different capacities including bootstrapping of protocols. For Airdrop and Proof-of-Burn based bootstrapping to be ideal, these protocols must satisfy all properties outlined in Definition 4.4. Based on this, in Claim 1, we show that Airdrop is not an ideal bootstrapping protocol as it is not IC.\n# Claim 1. An Airdrop-based bootstrapping protocol is not IC.\nClaim 1. An Airdrop-based bootstrapping protocol is not IC.\nWe defer the proof to Appendix C which uses the property of airdrop that launching a Sybil attack does not affect utility as it does not increase \u03a9. It is because pseudo-identities have no on-chain transactions establishing a relationship with the player launching the Sybil attack; thus, the collusion is undetected. Furthermore, to show that Proof-of-Burn (PoB) is not an ideal bootstrapping protocol, Claim 2 proves that it does not satisfy IR.\n# Claim 2. A Proof-of-Burn-based bootstrapping protocol is not IR.\nFor the proof, refer to Appendix D, we show that a PoB bootstrapped cryptocurrency will always be upward-pegged (also referred to as one-way pegging [48]). Thus, a player\u2019s maximum utility from PoB bootstrapping in expectation is less than the utility from abstaining from the protocol. Motivated by the switch of Ethereum from PoW to PoS [14], we next discuss the potential of PoW as a bootstrapping protocol.\n# 6.2 W2SB: PoW-based Bootstrapping\nProof-of-Work (PoW) is a promising choice for a bootstrapping protocol as it offers Sybil resistance by design (Section 3.1). PoW involves solving a cryptographic puzzle to mine (propose) a block. Let \ud835\udc5fb be the reward obtained by the miner6 on successfully solving the puzzle. We consider that each miner \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc43invests some computational resource (aka. mining power). Consider\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56be the mining power if the invested cost is according to their true valuation (i.e. \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56is mining power when \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56). The total mining power when all miners \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc43report their true valuation is \ud835\udc40= \ufffd \ud835\udc56\u2208[\ud835\udc5b] \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56. The cost incurred per unit of mining power in a round is \ud835\udf12in expectation. For IC, we require \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56gets a higher reward with mining power \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56(corresponding to \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56) than with \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56+ \ud835\udc4e(corresponding to \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56> \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56) or \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc4e(corresponding to \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56< \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56). W2SB: IC and IR. We abstract out a Proof-of-Work based bootstrapping protocol which runs for a specified number of rounds (say \ud835\udc47) and satisfies conditions stated in Lemma 6.1 as Work to Stake Bootstrap (W2SB). We show that W2SB is an Ideal Bootstrapping Protocol. Towards this, we first show with Lemma 6.1 that W2SB is both IC and IR (given some conditions on \ud835\udf12,\ud835\udc5fb and \ud835\udc40).\nAppendix E presents the formal proof. In the proof, for IR, we show that the expected utility of any miner, in a single round, is greater than or equal to the utility of abstaining if \ud835\udf12\u00b7\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc5fb \u22641. Next, for IC, we show that eliciting \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56< \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56and > \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56both gives a lower utility when \ud835\udf12\u00b7\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc5fb \u2265(1 \u2212\ud835\udc5amin \ud835\udc40).\n\u2265( \u2212 ) Note. Condition (1) in Lemma 6.1 is a natural requirement for PoW and states that the mining difficulty must be such that the mining cost does not exceed the expected reward from mining. On the other hand, condition (2) requires that for any set of valuations \ud835\udf3d, there does not exist a miner who is incentivized to increase its mining power. We remark that these are mild requirements and can be satisfied by changing \ud835\udf12, which depends on the difficulty of the cryptographic puzzle (a tunable parameter in PoW/W2SB). W2SB: Decentralization. To show that W2SB is decentralized, we show the existence of a finite \ud835\udc47for an arbitrary \ud835\udc67\u2208R>0 such that if W2SB is run for \ud835\udc47rounds, \u03a9\u2605< \ud835\udc67We assume the dynamic participation of miners is according to an arbitrary distribution \ud835\udc3d\u2190Z(\ud835\udf07, \ud835\udf0e). The CDF (\u03a8) is defined over non-negative integers \u03a8 : Z\u22650 \u2192R\u22650. Likewise, the PMF(\ud835\udf13) is also defined over the set of non-negative integers \ud835\udf13: Z\u22650 \u2192R\u22650 and made discrete\n6We refer to the strategic players as miners here, as miners may be a more accessible term for PoW-based bootstrapping.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/243f/243f2750-a66b-4603-9f11-43fe0faf6aa9.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: C-NORM against rounds for different stopping time \ud835\udc47for distribution N (7, 3)</div>\n# Figure 2: C-NORM against rounds for different stopping time \ud835\udc47for distribution N (7, 3)\nusing the PDF \ud835\udc53as \ud835\udf13(\ud835\udc3d= \ud835\udc5e) = \u222b\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc5e\u22121 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc3d= \ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.

Hence, W2SB is Ideal Bootstrapping Protocol by Definition 4.4 \u25a1\n# 7 W2SB: EXPERIMENTS & DISCUSSION\nWe now study the empirical change in C-NORM with a change in the number of rounds, \ud835\udc47. From Theorem 3, we know that W2SB reaches an arbitrary level of decentralization (reflected by a decrease in C-NORM) for a sufficient \ud835\udc47. Our experiments aim to quantify C-NORM in a PoS system when W2SB is run for different values of \ud835\udc47. We begin by explaining our experimental setup, followed by the results and their discussion.\nExperimental Setup. We simulate a PoS-based blockchain bootstrapped using W2SB. To empirically measure C-NORM, we run W2SB for different stopping times \ud835\udc47\u2208{100, 200, 500, 750, 1000}, after which the PoS protocol is run for remaining (1000\u2212\ud835\udc47) rounds. To capture each participant \ud835\udc56\u2019s dynamic arrival, we define the random variable J\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61, which takes the value 1 if \ud835\udc56joins the system\nat round \ud835\udc61and 0 otherwise. We model J\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\u223c\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc58= 3) from a chi-squared distribution with degree of freedom \ud835\udc58= 3. We believe this distribution aptly exhibits participant arrival: sudden increase at first, which peaks closer to the starting, followed by a gradual decrease and long tail. We simulate three different instances where each player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56samples its mining power \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc56(proportional to \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56) from (1) Gaussian \ud835\udf19\u223cN (7, 3), (2) Uniform \ud835\udf19\u223cU(0, 50), and (3) Exponential \ud835\udf19\u223cExp(\ud835\udf06= 1) distributions.7 Results & Inference. Figure 2 depicts our results. We make the following key observations. (1) In W2SB \u03a9\u2605\u21920 as \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e. From Figure 2, we observe that if the W2SB runs for a sufficiently large\ud835\udc47, then C-NORM tends to zero, i.e., \u03a9\u2605\u21920. (2) C-NORM does not decrease after Bootstrapping. We observe that for rounds > \ud835\udc47, C-NORM saturates to a fixed value. This is because the PoS protocol does not cause any change in C-NORM of the protocol, as desired. (3) W2SB achieves \u03a9\u2605\u2264\ud835\udc67for any \ud835\udc67> 0. Any \ud835\udc67can be achieved in a finite number of rounds in W2SB, as \u03a9\u2605tends to 0 asymptotically. The smaller value of \ud835\udc67, the larger number of rounds required. E.g., the green curve in Figure 2 with small \ud835\udc47is relatively centralized.\nDiscussion. Our results (both theoretical and empirical) show that W2SB is an Ideal bootstrapping protocol that achieves sufficiently small C-NORM values. The number of rounds for which W2SB is run (\ud835\udc47) is a hyper-parameter that is decided by protocol descriptor, allowing a tradeoff between higher levels of decentralization (by increasing \ud835\udc47) and lower energy consumption (by decreasing \ud835\udc47). Ethereum Merge \u2013 an instance of W2SB. Ethereum also used PoW initially before switching to PoS (aka the Merge [14]). Although the intention of the Merge might not have been decentralized stake distribution, the consequence was that Ethereum became a decentralized PoS-based blockchain.\n# 8 CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK\nConclusion. This work attempted to resolve the problem of centralization during bootstrapping of PoS-based blockchains. Towards this, we first presented a game-theoretic model of bootstrapping, \u0393bootstrap. With this, we defined an ideal bootstrapping protocol, i.e., a protocol that simultaneously satisfies IR, IC, and decentralization. To quantify centralization, we introduced C-NORM which measures centralization in PoS-based blockchains. We show the effectiveness of C-NORM against existing metrics, using the centralization game, \u0393\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61. We then analyzed existing protocols under our model to show that while Airdrop and Proof-of-Burn are not IC and IR, respectively, PoW-based bootstrapping (W2SB) is an Ideal bootstrapping protocol. Our work lays the theoretical foundations for further analysis of PoS-based blockchains. Future Work. Decentralized bootstrapping in PoS-based blockchain is relatively new. One potential future direction is to explore verifiable random functions [43] for greater energy efficiency than W2SB. Another challenge with PoS-based blockchains is that centralization may occur due to stake pools post the bootstrapping\n7We remark that the general trend presented remains similar for different distribution parameters (refer Appendix G).\n7We remark that the general trend presented remains similar for different distribution parameters (refer Appendix G).\nphase. Tackling post-bootstrapping threats to decentralization may be an interesting future direction to explore.\n# REFERENCES\n[1] 2023. CoinMarketCap. coinmarketcap.com/.

To show that C-NORM can distinguish between \ud835\udc600 and\ud835\udc601 we consider any (arbitrary) \ud835\udc600 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34and corresponding \ud835\udc601 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34. We show for each such sampling for\ud835\udc600,\ud835\udc601 we have \u03a9\u2605(\ud835\udc600) \u2260\u03a9\u2605(\ud835\udc601) which concludes our proof. We are considering the experiment being conducted when the stake distribution is happening through an Incentive-Compatible bootstrapping protocol. Therefore, \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56for any player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56. Consider two samples \ud835\udc600 \u2208\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34and \ud835\udc601 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc600). The goal is for \u03a9\u2605to distinguish between (\ud835\udc600,\ud835\udc601). First we calculate \u03a9\u2605for \ud835\udc601. Since there are no edges, \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56. According to the bootstrapping protocol, the allocated stake \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56is proportional to the valuation \ud835\udf03for a player \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56. Therefore, we get \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc56/ \u02c6\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc56=",

            "method description": "The method involves running a PoW protocol for a specified number of rounds to distribute stakes before transitioning to a PoS protocol.",
            "method steps": [
                "Initiate the PoW protocol for a defined number of rounds.",
                "Distribute rewards based on the mining power of participants.",
                "Transition to the PoS protocol after the bootstrapping phase."
            ],
            "principle": "W2SB is effective in solving the problem because it inherently provides Sybil resistance and ensures that stakes are allocated based on true valuations, leading to a more decentralized system."
        },
        "experiments": {
            "evaluation setting": "The experiments involved simulating a PoS blockchain bootstrapped using W2SB for varying stopping times (100, 200, 500, 750, 1000 rounds) to measure the impact on C-NORM.",
            "evaluation method": "C-NORM was empirically measured after running W2SB for different rounds, observing how it converges to lower values as the number of rounds increases."
        },
        "conclusion": "The paper concludes that W2SB is an ideal bootstrapping protocol that effectively reduces centralization in PoS blockchains, demonstrating that a sufficient number of rounds leads to decentralized outcomes.",
        "discussion": {
            "advantage": "The main advantage of W2SB is its ability to leverage PoW's inherent properties to ensure a decentralized initial stake distribution, making it resilient to centralization threats.",
            "limitation": "A limitation of the method is that it relies on the initial PoW phase, which may still face challenges in terms of energy consumption and efficiency compared to pure PoS systems.",
            "future work": "Future research could explore the integration of verifiable random functions for enhanced efficiency and address potential centralization risks that arise post-bootstrapping."
