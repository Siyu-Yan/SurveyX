## ü§îWhat is SurveyX?

![surveyx_frame](assets/SurveyX.png)

**SurveyX** is an advanced academic survey automation system that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-quality, domain-specific academic papers and surveys.üöÄ

By simply providing a **paper title** and **keywords** for literature retrieval, users can request comprehensive academic papers or surveys tailored to specific topics.

If you're curious about how SurveyX works or want to understand the underlying technology and methodology, feel free to check out our üìë[website](http://www.surveyx.cn), where we provide an in-depth explanation of the system's architecture, data processing methods, and experimental results.

## ü§î What‚Äôs This Git For?

This GitHub repository is **designed to provide a platform where users can request the generation** of high-quality, domain-specific academic surveys by simply submitting an issue. The main purpose of this repository is to allow users to easily create and receive tailored academic surveys or papers, which are generated using SurveyXüìÑ

By submitting an issue with a paper title and keywords for literature search, users can quickly generate a comprehensive review paper or survey on a specific topic. This process streamlines academic research by automating paper creation, saving users time and effort in compiling research content. üìöüí°

## üñãÔ∏èHow to Request a Custom Paper via Issue

To request a paper, create a new issue with the following details:

- **Paper Title**: Provide the title of the paper you need.
- **Keywords for Literature Search**: Provide keywords separated by commas that will help retrieve relevant literature and guide the content generation (e.g. "AI in healthcare, climate change impact on agriculture, ethical implications of AI"). We recommend that the number of keywords be limited to **4 ~ 5** for optimal results.
- **Your email**(optional): Please provide your email address so that we can notify you promptly once the paper is ready.

### üí¨Example Issue Submission

> **Title**: Controllable text generation of LLM: A Survey
>
> **Keywords**: AI, healthcare, ethical implications, technology adoption, AI-driven diagnostics
>
> **Email**: <xxxxxxxx@SurveyX.cn>

Once your request is submitted, the generated paper will be placed in the **user requests** folder. Please allow 1-2 business days for processing and generation. ‚è≥

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

- Our retrieval engine may not have access to many papers that require commercial licensing. If your research topic requires papers from sources other than arXiv, the quality and comprehensiveness of the generated papers may be affected due to limitations in our retrieval scope.
- We currently only support the generation of English academic survey generation. Support for other languages is not available.
- To ensure fair access for all users, each user is limited to one generation per day, prioritizing diverse user needs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èDisclaimer

SurveyX uses advanced language models to assist with the generation of academic papers. However, it is important to note that the generated content is a tool for research assistance. Users should verify the accuracy of the generated papers, as SurveyX cannot guarantee full compliance with academic standards.
