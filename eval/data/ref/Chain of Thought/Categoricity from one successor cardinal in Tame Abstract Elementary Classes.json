(1) Elementary classes. (2) Homogeneous model theory (as Galois-types are sets of formulas). (3) The class of atomic models of a first-order theory (from [Sh 87a]). I.e. the class introduced to study the spectrum function of L\u03c91,\u03c9 sentence (under mild assumptions) is an example of a tame AEC. (4) Let K be an AEC, and suppose there exists \u03ba strongly compact cardinal such that LS(K) < \u03ba. Let \u00b50 := \u2136(2\u03ba)+. Makkai and Shelah prove that if K is categorical in some \u03bb+ > \u00b50 then has the AP. By further results of [MaSh] the Galois-types can be identified with sets of formulas from L\u03ba,\u03ba. Thus K is \u03ba-tame. (5) The class of algebraically closed fields with pseudo-exponentiation studied by Zilber is tame. (6) Using the method of [GrKv] Villaveces and Zambrano in [ViZa] have shown that the class of Hrushovski\u2019s fusion Kfus is \u21350-tame. (7) Baldwin [Ba2] combining arguments from [GrKv] and [Zi2] have shown that the class K of two sorted structures (V, A) when A is semi-abelian with a group homomorphism exp from a finite dimensional Q-vector space V onto A with kernel ZN is \u21350-tame AEC with AP (details are in section 4 of [Ba2]). (8) It is a corollary of [GrKv] that good frames that are excellent (in the sense of [Sh 705]) are tame.\n2While there are structural results for continuous model theory, this context is not an AEC. The classification theory for continuous model theory is parallel to the BuechlerLessmann paper on homogeneous models [BuLe]. One could apply the definition of tame to classes satisfying the same properties as models of a continuous theory. In this view, continuous model theory is tame.\nAs further evidence to the importance of tame AECs, recent progress on Shelah\u2019s Categoricity Conjecture has been made under the assumption of tameness by combining the work of [Sh 394] with [GrVa1]. Fact 1.2. Suppose K is a \u03c7-tame abstract elementary class satisfying the amalgamation and joint embedding properties. Let \u00b50 := Hanf(K). If \u03c7 \u2264 \u2136(2\u00b50)+ and K is categorical in some \u03bb+ > \u2136(2\u00b50)+, then K is categorical in \u00b5 for all \u00b5 > \u2136(2\u00b50)+. Previous results (e.g. [Sh 87a], [Sh 87b], [MaSh], [KoSh], [Sh 472] and [Sh 705]) of Shelah in the direction of upward categoricity required not only model-theoretic assumptions but also set-theoretic assumptions. An interesting feature of our work is that it is an upward categoricity transfer theorem in ZFC. In particular it can be viewed as an improvement of the main result of [MaSh] where the assumption of existence of a strongly compact cardinal is made. One distinction between Fact 1.2 and Conjecture 1.1 is that Fact 1.2 applies only to classes which are categorical above the second Hanf number, \u2136(2Hanf(K))+. One motivation for this paper is to improve Fact 1.2 getting a better approximation to Conjecture 1.1 for tame abstract elementary classes. In fact our results extend beyond the scope of Conjecture 1.1 since we are able, for instance, to conclude that for a LS(K)-tame abstract elementary class with arbitrarily large models satisfying the amalgamation and joint embedding properties if the class is categorical in LS(K) and LS(K)+ then the class is categorical in all \u00b5 \u2265LS(K). In his paper [Sh 394], Shelah proved that from categoricity in \u03bb+ above the second Hanf number, one could deduce categoricity below \u03bb+. Under the additional assumption of tameness, we provide an argument to transfer categoricity in \u03bb+ upwards in [GrVa1]. The main step in our proof is: Fact 1.3 (Corollary 4.3 of [GrVa1]). Suppose that K has arbitrarily large models, satisfies the amalgamation property and is \u03c7-tame with \u03c7 \u2265LS(K). If K is categorical in both \u03bb+ and \u03bb with \u03bb \u2265\u03c7 and \u03bb > LS(K), then K is categorical in every \u00b5 with \u00b5 \u2265\u03bb. A breakthrough in [GrVa1] was to go from categoricity in \u03bb+ to categoricity in \u03bb++ when \u03bb+ was above the second Hanf number of the class. Working under the assumption of categoricity above the second Hanf number provided us the convenience of categoricity in \u03bb with an application of [Sh 394]. Recently, Lessmann expressed interest in whether or not the upward categoricity transfer theorem (Fact 1.3) could be proved from categoricity in only one successor cardinal. He communicated to us that he could use our methods along with quasi-minimal types and countable superlimits to prove the desired result for \u21350-tame classes with LS(K) = \u21350 [Le], but was unable to prove it when LS(K) is uncountable. This paper answers Lessmann\u2019s question. Using the ideas and arguments from [GrVa1] along with quasi-minimal\ntypes, we deduce from categoricity in \u03bb+ categoricity in \u03bb++ for \u03bb > LS(K) with no restrictions on the size of LS(K) or the tameness cardinal. We also improve Fact 1.3 by removing the assumption that \u03bb > LS(K). Our proof that categoricity in \u03bb+ implies categoricity in \u03bb++ under the described setting involves showing that there are nice minimal types (which we have called deep-rooted quasi-minimal) over limit models, and these quasiminimal types have no Vaughtian pairs of cardinality \u03bb++. Then using a characterization of limit models (Theorem 4.1 from [GrVa1]), we show that this is enough to prove the model of cardinality \u03bb++ is saturated. We are grateful to John Baldwin and Olivier Lessmann for asking questions without which this paper would not exist.\n# 2. Preliminaries\nThroughout this paper, we make the assumptions that our abstract elementary class K has arbitrarily large models and satisfies the joint embedding and amalgamation properties. We will also assume that the class is \u03c7-tame. We let K\u00b5 stand for the set of all models of K of cardinality \u00b5. In the natural way, we use K\u2264\u00b5 and K\u2265\u00b5. We will be using notation and definitions consistent with [GrVa1]. Many of the propositions can be proved in more general settings, but we leave an exploration of those possibilities for future work. In abstract elementary classes saturated models have various guises. In some cases, it is more prudent to work with a limit model as opposed to a saturated model. Definition 2.1.

We will be using the following fact which is a consequence of [Va]; or see [GrVaVi] for an exposition and proof.\nFact 2.2 (Uniqueness of Limit Models). Suppose that K is an abstract elementary class satisfying the amalgamation property and is categorical in some \u03bb. If LS(K) < \u00b5 < \u03bb and M0 \u2208K\u00b5, then for every two limit models M1 and M2 over M0, if M1 and M2 both have the same cardinality \u03ba < \u03bb, then they are isomorphic over M0. Notation 2.3. In light of Fact 2.2, when the cardinality of the limit model is clear, we omit the parameters \u00b5 and \u03c3 and refer to (\u00b5, \u03c3)-limit models as limit models.\nA corollary of Fact 2.2 is that\nProposition 2.4. Assuming categoricity in \u03bb and the joint embedding and amalgamation properties, for \u00b5 with LS(K) < \u00b5 < \u03bb, every saturated model of cardinality \u00b5 is also a (\u00b5, \u03c3)-limit model for any limit ordinal \u03c3 < \u00b5+.\nProof. First we show that any limit model of cardinality \u00b5 is saturated. Then by our assumptions and the uniqueness of saturated models (Lemma 0.26 of [Sh 576]), we can conclude that any saturated model of cardinality \u00b5 is isomorphic to a limit model of cardinality \u00b5. Suppose that M is a limit model of cardinality \u00b5. Fix \u03ba such that LS(K) \u2264 \u03ba < \u00b5. Fix N1 \u227aK M of cardinality \u03ba and p = ga-tp(a/N1, N2) with \u2225N2\u2225= \u03ba. Since M is a limit model, we can find a continuous decomposition of M into \u27e8Mi | i < \u03ba+\u27e9such that each Mi is a model of cardinality \u00b5 and Mi+1 is universal over Mi. By the regularity of \u03ba+, we can find i < \u03ba+ such that N1 \u227aK Mi. Invoking the amalgamation property, we can amalgamate N2 and Mi over N1 as in the diagram below:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4676/46762d22-48e3-4a5a-87c5-0fbd58a3389f.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nWe may assume that the amalgam N \u2217has cardinality \u00b5. Since Mi+1 universal over Mi we can extend the commutative diagram:\nNotice that f \u25e6g witnesses that f(g(a)) \u2208Mi+1 realizes ga-tp(a/N1, N2).\nGalois-stability and the amalgamation property are enough to establish the existence of limit models (see [Sh 600] for the statement and [GrVa2] for a proof). Limit models exist in categorical AECs since categoricity implies Galois-stability:\nFact 2.5 (Claim 1.7(a) of [Sh 394] or see [Ba1] for a proof). If K is categorical in \u03bb > LS(K), then K is Galois-stable in all \u00b5 with LS(K) \u2264\u00b5 < \u03bb.\nAnother consequence of \u00b5-stability is the existence of minimal types. As a replacement for first order strongly minimal types, Shelah has suggested using minimal types in [Sh 394]. We in [GrVa1] found that a more restrictive minimality condition (rooted minimal) could be used to transfer categoricity upward.\nFact 2.7 (Density of Minimal Types [Sh 394]). Let \u00b5 > LS(K). If K  Galois-stable in \u00b5, then for every N \u2208K\u00b5 and every q \u2208ga-S(N), there ar M \u2208K\u00b5 and p \u2208ga-S(M) such that N \u2aafK M, q \u2264p and p is minimal.\nThe main obstacle of minimal types in this context is that while there are minimal types in stable AECs, the minimal types may be trivially minimal, meaning that the minimal type has no non-algebraic extensions. As in [Sh 48] and [Zi] we replace this notion of minimality with quasi-minimality. Since a non-algebraic type may not have any non-algebraic extensions, we distinguish these non-algebraic types from the well-behaved non-algebraic types. A non-algebraic type p \u2208ga-S(M) is big iff for every M\u2032 \u227bK M of cardinality \u2225M\u2225, there is a non-algebraic extensions of p to M\u2032 (see Definition 6.1 of [Sh 48]). Notice that this is equivalent to requiring that there is a big extension of p to M\u2032. Almost thirty years after Shelah\u2019s [Sh 48], Zilber rediscovered the notion of minimality and used perhaps the better notation quasi-minimality to distinguish it from the first order relatives. As in [Zi], we say a big type p is quasi-minimal iff for any N \u2208K extending M there is at most one non-algebraic extension of p to N. Analogous to the minimal case, we can define deep-rooted quasi-minimal. Most of the results concerning minimal types can be proved for quasi-minimal types with minimal work. We will show that quasi-minimal types exist in Section 3. For now notice that the assumptions of the amalgamation property and no maximal models give us the following:\n# Remark 2.8. For any M \u2208K, there exists p \u2208ga-S(M) such that p is big.\nAnother consequence of \u00b5-stability is that \u00b5-splitting is well-behaved and the notions of non-algebraic and big types over limit models are the same. We begin by reviewing some basic facts about \u00b5-splitting.\nFor M \u2208K\u2265\u00b5 and N \u227aK M we say that p \u2208ga-S(M) \u00b5-splits over N iff there exist two models N1, N2 \u2208K\u00b5 and an isomorphism f : N1 \u223c= N2 such that N \u227aK Nl \u227aK M for l = 1, 2; f \u21beN = idN and p \u21beN2 \u0338= f(p \u21be N1). Under the assumption of categoricity, \u00b5-splitting has an extension property (See Corollary 2 of [Ba2] or Theorem 12.8 of [Ba1]) in addition to the existence property which follows from Galois-stability in \u00b5 (see Lemma 6.3 of [Sh 394]): Fact 2.9. Suppose that K is categorical in some \u03bb > LS(K). Let \u00b5 be a cardinal such that LS(K) \u2264\u00b5 and let \u03c3 be a limit ordinal with LS(K) \u2264\u03c3 < \u00b5+. Then, for every (\u00b5, \u03c3)-limit model M and every type p \u2208ga-S(M), there exists N \u2ab5K M of cardinality \u00b5 such that for every M\u2032 \u2208K\u2264\u03bb extending M, there exists q \u2208ga-S(M\u2032) an extension of p such that q does not \u00b5-split over N. In particular p does not \u00b5-split over N. Moreover, if M is a (\u00b5, \u03c3)-limit model witnessed by \u27e8Mi | i < \u03c3\u27e9, then there is a i < \u03c3 such that p does not \u00b5-split over Mi. The only other property of \u00b5-splitting that we will explicitly use is an observation that non-splitting extensions of non-algebraic types remain nonalgebraic.\nThe only other property of \u00b5-splitting that we will explicitly use is a observation that non-splitting extensions of non-algebraic types remain non algebraic.\nFact 2.10 (Corollary 2.8 of [GrVa1]). Let N, M, M\u2032 \u2208K\u00b5 be such that M\u2032 is universal over M and M is a limit model over N. Suppose that p \u2208ga-S(M) does not \u00b5-split over N and p is non-algebraic. For every M\u2032 \u2208K extending M of cardinality \u00b5, if q \u2208ga-S(M\u2032) is an extension of p and does not \u00b5-split over N, then q is non-algebraic.\n# We can use non-splitting to show that\nWe can use non-splitting to show that\nFact 2.11. Suppose that K is categorical in some \u03bb > LS(K) and \u00b5 is a cardinal < \u03bb. If M is a limit model of cardinality \u00b5, then p \u2208ga-S(M) is non-algebraic iff p is big.\ncardinal < \u03bb. If M is a limit model of cardinality \u00b5, then p \u2208ga-S(M) is non-algebraic iff p is big. Proof. As in the proof of Theorem I.4.10 [Va] or see Proposition 1.16[Le]. At the referee\u2019s suggestion, we have included a proof here. Clearly every big type is non-algebraic. Suppose M is a limit model witnessed by \u27e8Mi | i < \u03c3\u27e9and p = ga-tp(a/M) is non-algebraic. By Fact 2.9, there is an i < \u03c3 such that p does not \u00b5-split over Mi. Let M\u2032 be a K-extension of M of cardinality \u00b5. We now show that p can be extended to a non-algebraic type p\u2032 \u2208ga-S(M\u2032). By the definition of limit model and our choice of \u27e8Mi | i < \u03c3\u27e9, we know that Mi+1 is universal over Mi. Thus there is a K-mapping h\u2032 : M\u2032 \u2192Mi+1 such that h \u21beMi = idMi. Because of we are working inside a monster model, we can extend h\u2032 to h \u2208AutMi(C). Our candidate for a non-algebraic extension of p to M\u2032 will be p\u2032 := ga-tp(h\u22121(a)/M\u2032). Immediately we see that p\u2032 is non-algebraic since ga-tp(a/h(M\u2032)) was non-algebraic. We claim that p\u2032 is in fact an extension of p, that is that ga-tp(h\u22121(a)/M) = ga-tp(a/M). By monotonicity, of non-splitting, we have that ga-tp(a/h(M\u2032)\ndoes not \u00b5-split over Mi. By invariance, we have ga-tp(h\u22121(a)/M\u2032) also does not \u00b5-split over Mi. Now if ga-tp(h\u22121(a)/M) \u0338= ga-tp(a/M), we would witness that ga-tp(h\u22121(a)/M\u2032) \u00b5-splits over Mi via the mapping h. Thus p\u2032 \u21beM = p as required.\nWe now go into some details of a common construction in AECs. A variation of the proposition appears in the literature as Claim 0.31(2) of [Sh 576] and in the proof of Theorem II.7.1 of [Va], we isolate it here as Lemma 2.12. After detailing Lemma 2.12 to John Baldwin in e-mail correspondence in the Summer of 2004, we decided to include the proof here. Lemma 2.12. Suppose \u27e8Mi | i < \u03b1\u27e9is an \u227aK-increasing and continuous chain of models. Further assume that \u27e8pi \u2208ga-S(Mi) | i < \u03b1\u27e9is an increasing chain of types such that there are ai \u2208C with ai |= pi and \u227aK-mappings fi,j \u2208AutMi(C) with fi,j(ai) = aj for i \u2264j < \u03b1 such that for i \u2264j \u2264k we have that fi,k = fj,k \u25e6fi,j. Then there exists a\u03b1 \u2208C realizing each pi and there are fi,\u03b1 \u2208AutMi(C) with fi,\u03b1(ai) = a\u03b1. The proof uses direct limits, so we will review some facts first. Using the axioms of AEC and Shelah\u2019s Presentation Theorem, one can show that the union axiom of the definition of AEC has an alternative formulation (see [Sh 88] or Chapter 16 of [Gr2]): Definition 2.13. A partially ordered set (I, \u2264) is directed iff for every a, b \u2208I, there exists c \u2208I such that a \u2264c and b \u2264c. Fact 2.14 (P.M. Cohn 1965). Let (I, \u2264) be a directed set. If \u27e8Mt | t \u2208I\u27e9 and {ht,r | t \u2264r \u2208I} are such that (1) for t \u2208I, Mt \u2208K (2) for t \u2264r \u2208I, ht,r : Mt \u2192Mr is a \u227aK-embedding and (3) for t1 \u2264t2 \u2264t3 \u2208I, ht1,t3 = ht2,t3 \u25e6ht1,t2 and ht,t = idMt, then, whenever s = limt\u2208I t, there exist Ms \u2208K and \u227aK-mappings {ht,s | t \u2208I} such that\nfor t1 \u2264t2 \u2264s, ht1,s = ht2,s \u25e6ht1,t2 and hs,s = idMs.\nRemark 2.15. Cohn\u2019s proof gives us that Ms is an L(K)-structure. To show that Ms \u2208K and that ht,s are K-embeddings we use Shelah\u2019s presentation theorem. Definition 2.16. (1) (\u27e8Mt | t \u2208I\u27e9, {ht,s | t \u2264s \u2208I}) from Fact 2.14 is called a directed system. (2) We say that Ms together with \u27e8ht,s | t \u2264s\u27e9satisfying the conclusion of Fact 2.14 is a direct limit of (\u27e8Mt | t < s\u27e9, {ht,r | t \u2264r < s}).\nRemark 2.15. Cohn\u2019s proof gives us that Ms is an L(K)-structure. To show that Ms \u2208K and that ht,s are K-embeddings we use Shelah\u2019s presentation theorem.\nDefinition 2.16. (1) (\u27e8Mt | t \u2208I\u27e9, {ht,s | t \u2264s \u2208I}) from Fact 2.14 is called a directed system. (2) We say that Ms together with \u27e8ht,s | t \u2264s\u27e9satisfying the conclusion of Fact 2.14 is a direct limit of (\u27e8Mt | t < s\u27e9, {ht,r | t \u2264r < s}).\n\u22a3\nProof of Lemma 2.12. Let \u27e8pi \u2208ga-S(Mi) | i < \u03b1\u27e9be an increasing chain of types and \u27e8Mi | i < \u03b1\u27e9a \u227aK-increasing chain of models with \u27e8fi,j | i \u2264j < \u03b1\u27e9and ai as in the statement of the lemma. Notice that (\u27e8Ci | i < \u03b1\u27e9, \u27e8fi,j | i \u2264j < \u03b1\u27e9) forms a directed system where Ci = C for all i. Let C\u2217 \u03b1 and \u27e8f \u2217 i,\u03b1 | i \u2264\u03b1\u27e9be a direct limit to this system. Outright we don\u2019t have much control over this limit, but by the following claims we will be able to chose a limit (C\u03b1, \u27e8fi,\u03b1 | i \u2264\u03b1\u27e9) so that \ufffd i<\u03b1 Mi \u2aafK C\u03b1 = C and fi,\u03b1 \u21beMi = idMi. First notice that we can take C\u03b1 to be C since a direct limit of automorphisms is an isomorphism using the construction of direct limits from [Gra]. Claim 2.17. \u27e8f \u2217 i,\u03b1 \u21beMi | i \u2264\u03b1\u27e9is increasing. Proof of Claim 2.17. Let i < j < \u03b1 be given. By construction fi,j \u21beMi = idMi .\nAn application of f \u2217 j,\u03b1 yields\nSince f \u2217 i,\u03b1 and f \u2217 j,\u03b1 come from a direct limit of the system which includes the mapping fi,j, we have\nCombining the equalities yields\nThis completes the proof of Claim 2.17.\nBy the claim, we have that f := \ufffd i<\u03b1 f \u2217 i,\u03b1 \u21beMi is a \u227aK-mapping from \ufffd i<\u03b1 Mi onto \ufffd i<\u03b1 f \u2217 i,\u03b1(Mi). Since C is saturated and model homogeneous, we can extend f to F \u2208Aut(C). Now consider the direct limit defined by C\u03b1 := F \u22121(C\u2217 \u03b1) with \u27e8fi,\u03b1 := F \u22121 \u25e6f \u2217 i,\u03b1 | i < \u03b1\u27e9and f\u03b1,\u03b1 = idC\u03b1. Notice that fi,\u03b1 \u21beMi = F \u22121 \u25e6f \u2217 i,\u03b1 \u21be Mi = idMi for i < \u03b1. Thus \ufffd i<\u03b1 Mi \u2aafK C\u03b1. Let a\u03b1 := f0,\u03b1(a0). The following argument explains why ga-tp(a\u03b1/ \ufffd i<\u03b1 M is an upper bound for \u27e8pi | i < \u03b1\u27e9.\nProof of Claim 2.18. Fix i < \u03b1. Notice that by the definition of direct limit we have a\u03b1 = f0,\u03b1(a0) = fi,\u03b1 \u25e6f0,i(a0). But by our choice of f0,i we know that f0,i(a0) is actually ai. Thus fi,\u03b1 is an automorphism of C fixing Mi taking ai to a\u03b1. So ga-tp(ai/Mi) and ga-tp(a\u03b1/Mi) must be the same.\nMi)\nLemma 2.19. Suppose \u27e8Mi | i < \u03b1\u27e9is an \u227aK-increasing and continuous chain of limit models. If \u27e8pi \u2208ga-S(Mi) | i < \u03b1\u27e9is an increasing chain of quasi-minimal types and \u03b1 is a limit ordinal, then we can find ai \u2208C with ai |= pi and \u227aK-mappings fi,j \u2208AutMi(C) with fi,j(ai) = aj for i \u2264j < \u03b1 such that for i \u2264j \u2264k we have that fi,k = fj,k \u25e6fi,j. Proof. We find ai and fk,i by induction on i. For i = 0, take a0 \u2208C to be some realization of p0 and f0,0 := idC. Suppose that we have defined ai and fk,i for all k \u2264i. Let ai+1 be some realization of pi+1 in C. Since the types are increasing, we can find fi,i+1 \u2208AutMi C with fi,i+1(ai) = ai+1. Define fk,i+1 := fi,i+1 \u25e6fi,i+1. We use quasi-minimal types to get past limit stage. Suppose that we have defined fj,k for all j \u2264k < i with i a limit ordinal. By Lemma 2.12 there exists a\u2217\u2208C and fj,i \u2208AutMj C with fj,i \u21beMj = idMj and f \u2217 j,i(aj) = a\u2217. This a\u2217comes from a direct limit construction and may not realize the same type as ai over Mi. However, ga-tp(a\u2217/Mi) is a nonalgebraic extension of ga-tp(a0/M0), which was quasi-minimal. Since Mi is also a limit model, then ga-tp(a\u2217/Mi) is big. So, we can actually conclude, by quasi-minimality that the types of a\u2217and ai over Mi agree. So we can fix g \u2208AutMi(C) such that g(a\u2217) = ai. Then fj,i := g \u25e6f \u2217 j,i is as required. \u22a3 Corollary 2.20. Suppose \u27e8Mi | i < \u03b1\u27e9is an \u227aK-increasing and continuous chain of limit models. If \u27e8pi \u2208ga-S(Mi) | i < \u03b1\u27e9is an increasing chain of quasi-minimal types and \u03b1 is a limit ordinal, then there is a p\u03b1 \u2208ga-S(\ufffd i<\u03b1 Mi) extending each of the pi. Proof. Follows from Lemma 2.19 and Lemma 2.12.\nProof. Follows from Lemma 2.19 and Lemma 2.12.\n3. Deep-rooted minimal types\nThe main aim of this section is to prove the existence of deep-rooted quasi-minimal types. We will use the idea of Shelah\u2019s density of minimal types to do this. Our work generalizes Lemma 6.6 of [Sh 48] where Shelah proves the existence of (quasi)-minimal types using a rank function. First notice that if the class is tame, then any big extension of a quasiminimal type is also quasi-minimal: Proposition 3.1 (Monotonicity of Minimal Types). Suppose K is \u03c7-tame for some \u03c7 with \u00b5 \u2265\u03c7. If p \u2208ga-S(M) is quasi-minimal with M \u2208K\u00b5, then for all N \u2208K extending M and every q \u2208ga-S(N) extending p, if q is big then q is quasi-minimal. If N is a limit model, then the assumption that q is big can be replaced with non-algebraic. Proof. The last sentence of the claim is Proposition 2.2 of [GrVa1] once we notice Fact 2.11. The proof of the rest of the claim is similar, but we include details here for completeness. Suppose that p is a quasi-minimal type over M with a big extension q to N. For the sake of contradiction assume that q is not quasi-minimal. Then\nThe main aim of this section is to prove the existence of deep-rooted quasi-minimal types. We will use the idea of Shelah\u2019s density of minimal types to do this. Our work generalizes Lemma 6.6 of [Sh 48] where Shelah proves the existence of (quasi)-minimal types using a rank function. First notice that if the class is tame, then any big extension of a quasiminimal type is also quasi-minimal:\n\u22a3\nthere exist distinct q1 and q2 non-algebraic extensions of q to some model N \u2032. By tameness, there exists M\u2032 of cardinality \u00b5 such that M \u227aK M\u2032 and q1 \u21beM\u2032 \u0338= q2 \u21beM\u2032. Since q1 \u21beM\u2032 and q2 \u21beM\u2032 are both non-algebraic extensions of p we have a contradiction to the quasi-minimality of p. \u22a3 Similar to the proof of the density of minimal types, Fact 2.7, we get quasi-minimal types. Moreover, instead of a density result, we can actually find quasi-minimal types over every limit model. This is one of the obstacles in working with minimal types. Proposition 3.2 (Existence of Quasi-Minimal Types over Limits). Suppose K is Galois-stable in \u00b5 and M \u2208K\u00b5 is a limit model. Then there exists a quasi-minimal type over M. Proof. We build a tree of types, but restrict ourselves to limit models throughout the construction. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that M \u2208K\u00b5 is a limit model and that there are no quasi-minimal types over M. By Remark 2.8 we can fix p \u2208ga-S(M) a big type. By induction on i < \u00b5+ we build a \u227aK-increasing and continuous chain of models, \u27e8Mi | i < \u00b5+\u27e9and a tree of types \u27e8p\u03b7 | \u03b7 \u2208<\u00b5+2\u27e9satisfying (1) Mi is a limit model of cardinality \u00b5 (2) Mi+1 is a limit model over Mi (3) p\u03b7 = ga-tp(a\u03b7/Mi) is big where i is the length of \u03b7 (4) p\u03b7\u02c6\u27e80\u27e9\u0338= p\u03b7\u02c6\u27e81\u27e9 (5) for all ordinals i \u2264j less than the length of \u03b7, we have p\u03b7\u21bei \u2264p\u03b7, and there exist f\u03b7\u21bei,\u03b7 \u2208AutM\u03b7\u21bei C such that f\u03b7\u21bei,\u03b7(a\u03b7\u21bei) = a\u03b7 and f\u03b7\u21bei,\u03b7 = f\u03b7\u21bej,\u03b7 \u25e6f\u03b7\u21bei,\u03b7\u21bej (6) p\u27e8\u27e9= p (7) M0 = M. Suppose that Mi and p\u03b7 \u2208ga-S(Mi) have been defined. Since Mi is isomorphic to M (by Fact 2.2), our assumption implies that p\u03b7 cannot be quasi-minimal. So we may fix an extension N of Mi and two distinct big extensions of p\u03b7 to N. Let a\u2032 \u03b7\u02c6\u27e80\u27e9and a\u2032 \u03b7\u02c6\u27e81\u27e9realize these big extensions and let M\u2032 1 \u2208K\u00b5 be some extension of N containing both a\u2032 \u03b7\u02c6\u27e80\u27e9and a\u2032 \u03b7\u02c6\u27e81\u27e9. Fix a (\u00b5, \u03c9)-limit model over N and call it Mi+1. By the definition of big types, there are a\u03b7\u02c6\u27e80\u27e9and a\u03b7\u02c6\u27e81\u27e9realizing big extensions of ga-tp(a\u2032 \u03b7\u02c6\u27e80\u27e9/N) and ga-tp(a\u2032 \u03b7\u02c6\u27e81\u27e9/N), respectively. For the limit stage of the construction notice that Mi := \ufffd j<i Mj is a limit model as guaranteed by condition (2). For \u03b7 \u2208i2 with i a limit ordinal, we choose p\u03b7 to be some (there may be more than one) non-algebraic extension of the p\u03b7\u21bej for j < i. This is possible by our construction of the f\u03b7\u21bej,\u03b7\u2019s and Lemma 2.12. This lemma also gives us the required f\u03b7\u21bej,\u03b7\u2019s. To see that this construction is enough, let i be the first ordinal < \u00b5+ such that 2i > \u00b5. Then, {p\u03b7 \u2208ga-S(Mi) | \u03b7 \u2208i2} witnesses that K is not Galois-stable in \u00b5.\nWe need an extension property for quasi-minimal types in order to find deep-rooted quasi-minimal types.\nProposition 3.3 (Extension Property for Quasi-Minimal Types). Let K be categorical in some \u03bb > \u03c7. Let \u00b5 be such that LS(K) \u2264\u00b5 \u2264\u03bb. If p \u2208ga-S(M) is quasi-minimal and M is a (\u00b5, \u03c3)-limit model for some limit ordinal satisfying LS(K) \u2264\u03c3 < \u00b5+, then for every M\u2032 \u2208K\u2264\u03bb extending M, there is a quasi-minimal q \u2208ga-S(M\u2032) such that q extends p. Furthermore if p does not \u00b5 split over some N, then q can be chosen so that q does not \u00b5-split over N.\n\u00b5-split over N. Proof. Without loss of generality M\u2032 is a limit model over M. Let p \u2208 ga-S(M) be quasi-minimal. Since M is (\u00b5, \u03c3)-limit model, using Fact 2.9, we can find a proper submodel N \u227aK M of cardinality \u00b5 such that for every M\u2032 \u2208K\u2264\u03bb there exists q \u2208ga-S(M\u2032) extending p such that q does not \u00b5-split over N. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that q is not quasi-minimal. Then tameness and Proposition 3.1 tells us that q must be algebraic. Let a \u2208M\u2032 realize q and Ma \u2208K\u00b5 contain a with M \u227aK Ma \u227aK M\u2032. Then q \u21beMa is also algebraic. However, since q \u21beMa does not \u00b5-split over N and extends p, by Corollary 2.10 we see that q \u21beMa is not-algebraic. This gives us a contradiction. \u22a3\nRemark 3.4. Proposition 3.3 holds for minimal types as well. Simply replace quasi-minimal with minimal in the proof. This will be used in the last section of the paper.\nPropositions 3.3 and 3.2 are key to get the existence of deep-rooted quasi minimal types.\nProposition 3.5 (Existence of deep-rooted quasi-minimal types). Let K be categorical in some \u03bb > \u03c7. Then for every M\u2032 \u2208K\u03bb, there exists a deeprooted quasi-minimal q \u2208ga-S(M\u2032). Furthermore, if M \u227aK M\u2032 is a limit model of cardinality \u00b5 with \u03c7 \u2264\u00b5 < \u03bb and p \u2208ga-S(M) is quasi-minimal, then we can find q \u2208ga-S(M\u2032) a deep-rooted quasi-minimal extension of p with root M.\nProof. Fix \u00b5 with \u03c7 \u2264\u00b5 < \u03bb. Notice that by Fact 2.5, K is Galois-stable in \u00b5. Choose M \u2208K\u00b5 to be some K-substructure of M\u2032. Since K is stable in \u00b5 and categorical in \u03bb, we may take M to be a (\u00b5, \u03c3)-limit model for some limit ordinal \u03c3 with LS(K) \u2264\u03c3 < \u00b5+. By Proposition 3.2 and monotonicity of quasi-minimal types, we can choose M such that there is a quasi-minimal type p \u2208ga-S(M). Then by Proposition 3.3, there exists a quasi-minimal q \u2208ga-S(M\u2032) extending p. q is rooted with root Mi.\nWe will show that for deep-rooted quasi-minimal types, there are no true Vaughtian-pairs. This is a variation of the result in [GrVa1] that for rooted minimal types there are no Vaughtian-pairs. Definition 4.1. Let M \u2208K be a limit model and p \u2208ga-S(M) nonalgebraic. Fix \u00b5 \u2265\u2225M\u2225. (1) A pair of models (N0, N1) is said to be a (p, \u00b5)-Vaughtian pair provided that N0, N1 both have cardinality \u00b5 and M \u2aafK N0 \u2ab5K N1 with no c \u2208N1\\N0 realizing p. (2) A (p, \u00b5)-Vaughtian pair (N0, N1) is a true (p, \u00b5)-Vaughtian pair iff N0 and N1 are both limit models. The ubiquity of the assumption of categoricity in a successor cardinal in the literature concerning Conjecture 1.1 can be explained by the proof of the following central result. The result uses a classical Vaughtian-construction in the spirit of Morley\u2019s work, and it appears in [Sh 394] as Claim (\u2217)8 of Theorem 9.7. Fact 4.2. Assume that K is categorical in some \u03bb+ > LS(K)+. Then for every limit model M \u2208K\u2264\u03bb and every minimal type p \u2208ga-S(M), there are no true (p, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pairs. Using the fact that all saturated models are limit models; that the union of an increasing chain of saturated models is saturated (Claim 6.7 of [Sh 394]) and Fact 2.11, the same argument for Fact 4.2 can be carried out to yield the following proposition. Proposition 4.3. Assume that K is categorical in some \u03bb+ > LS(K)+. Then for every limit model M \u2208K\u2264\u03bb and every quasi-minimal type p \u2208 ga-S(M), there are no true (p, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pairs. Notice that the previous argument works only when \u03bb is strictly larger than LS(K). We will come back to this issue in Section 6 and deal with the special case in which LS(K) = \u03c7 = \u03bb and K is categorical in both \u03bb and \u03bb+. The following Vaughtian-pair transfer theorem is a relative of Theorem 3.3 of [GrVa1]: Theorem 4.4. Suppose that K is categorical in some \u03bb+ > LS(K). Let p be a deep-rooted quasi-minimal type over a model M of cardinality \u03bb+. Fix a root N \u227aK M of cardinality \u03bb, with p \u21beN quasi-minimal. If K has a (p, \u03bb+)-Vaughtian pair, then there is a true (p \u21beN, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pair (N0, N1). Proof. Suppose that (N 0, N 1) form a (p, \u03bb+)-Vaughtian pair. By categoricity, we know that N 0 and N 1 are both saturated. Let C denote the set of all realizations of p \u21beN inside N 1. Fix a \u2208N 1\\N 0. We now construct \u27e8N 0 i , N 1 i \u2208K\u03bb | i < \u03bb+\u27e9satisfying the following:\nWe will show that for deep-rooted quasi-minimal types, there are no true Vaughtian-pairs. This is a variation of the result in [GrVa1] that for rooted minimal types there are no Vaughtian-pairs. Definition 4.1. Let M \u2208K be a limit model and p \u2208ga-S(M) nonalgebraic.

(1) A pair of models (N0, N1) is said to be a (p, \u00b5)-Vaughtian pair provided that N0, N1 both have cardinality \u00b5 and M \u2aafK N0 \u2ab5K N1 with no c \u2208N1\\N0 realizing p. (2) A (p, \u00b5)-Vaughtian pair (N0, N1) is a true (p, \u00b5)-Vaughtian pair iff N0 and N1 are both limit models.\nThe ubiquity of the assumption of categoricity in a successor cardinal i the literature concerning Conjecture 1.1 can be explained by the proof of th following central result. The result uses a classical Vaughtian-constructio in the spirit of Morley\u2019s work, and it appears in [Sh 394] as Claim (\u2217)8 o Theorem 9.7.\n(1) N 0 0 = N (2) N \u2113 i \u2ab5K N \u2113for \u2113= 0, 1 (3) the sequences \u27e8N 0 i | i < \u03bb+\u27e9and \u27e8N 1 i | i < \u03bb+\u27e9are both \u227aKincreasing and continuous (4) N \u2113 i+1 is a limit model over N \u2113 i for \u2113= 0, 1 (5) a \u2208N 1 i \\N 0 i and (6) Ci := C \ufffdN 1 i \u2286N 0 i+1. The construction follows from the fact that both N 0 and N 1 are saturated and homogeneous and the following: Claim 4.5. If d \u2208N 1 realizes p \u21beN 0 0 , then d \u2208N 0. Thus C \u2286N 0. Proof of Claim 4.5. Suppose that d \u2208N 1\\N 0 realizes p \u21beN 0 0 . Because N 0 is saturated, ga-tp(d/N 0) is not only non-algebraic, it is a big extension of p \u21beN 0 0 . Since p \u21beN 0 0 is quasi-minimal, we have that ga-tp(d/M) = p. Since (N 0, N 1) form a (p, \u03bb+)-Vaughtian pair, it must be the case that d \u2208N 0, contradicting our choice of d.\nThe construction is enough: Define E := \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 \u03b4 < \u03bb+ \u03b4 is a limit ordinal, for all i < \u03b4 and x \u2208N 1 i , if there exists j < \u03bb+ such that x \u2208Cj, then there exists j < \u03b4, such that x \u2208Cj \uf8fc \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8fd \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8fe . Notice that E is a club. (We only use the fact that E is non-empty.) Fix \u03b4 \u2208E. Claim 4.6. For every c \u2208N 1 \u03b4 \u2229C, we have c \u2208N 0 \u03b4 . Proof of Claim 4.6. Since \u27e8N 1 i | i < \u03bb+\u27e9is continuous, there is i < \u03b4 such that c \u2208N 1 i . Thus by the definition of E, there is a j < \u03b4 with c \u2208Cj. By condition (6) of the construction, we would have put c \u2208N 0 j+1 \u227aK N 0 \u03b4 . \u22a3 Notice that N 1 \u03b4 \u0338= N 0 \u03b4 since a \u2208N 1 \u03b4 \\N 0 \u03b4 . Thus Claim 4.6 allows us the conclude that we have constructed a (p \u21beN, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pair. We complete the proof by observing that condition (4) of the construction and our choice of a limit ordinal \u03b4 imply that both N 0 \u03b4 and N 1 \u03b4 are limit models. \u22a3 Remark 4.7. The same proof of Theorem 4.4 works with minimal in place of quasi-minimal. Thus for p a minimal type, notice that for (N0, N1) in the conclusion of Theorem 4.4 we have that (N0, N1) is a true (p \u21beN0, \u03bb)Vaughtian pair and p \u21beN0 is minimal. Furthermore N0 is a limit model over N. This extra information will be used in Section 6. Corollary 4.8. Let \u03bb > LS(K). If K is categorical in \u03bb+ and p is a deeprooted quasi-minimal type over a model of cardinality \u03bb+, then there are no (p, \u03bb+)-Vaughtian pairs.\nRemark 4.7. The same proof of Theorem 4.4 works with minimal in place of quasi-minimal. Thus for p a minimal type, notice that for (N0, N1) in the conclusion of Theorem 4.4 we have that (N0, N1) is a true (p \u21beN0, \u03bb)Vaughtian pair and p \u21beN0 is minimal. Furthermore N0 is a limit model over N. This extra information will be used in Section 6. Corollary 4.8. Let \u03bb > LS(K). If K is categorical in \u03bb+ and p is a deeprooted quasi-minimal type over a model of cardinality \u03bb+, then there are no (p, \u03bb+)-Vaughtian pairs.\n\u22a3\n\u22a3\n\u22a3\nProof. Suppose that (N 0, N 1) is a (p, \u03bb+)-Vaughtian pair and that N is both a root of p (with p \u21beN quasi-minimal) and a limit model of size \u03bb. Then by Theorem 4.4, there is a true (p \u21beN, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pair. This contradicts Proposition 4.3.\nCorollary 4.9. Let \u03bb > LS(K). If K is categorical in \u03bb+, then every deeprooted quasi-minimal type over a model N of cardinality \u03bb+ is realized \u03bb++ times in every model of cardinality \u03bb++ extending N.\nProof. Suppose M \u2208K\u03bb++ realizes p only \u03b1 < \u03bb+ times. Let A := {ai | i < \u03b1} be an enumeration of the realizations of p in M. We can find N0 \u2208K\u03bb+ such that N \ufffdA \u2286N0 \u227aK M. Since M has cardinality \u03bb++, we can find N1 \u2208K\u03bb+ such that N0 \u2ab5K N1 \u227aK M. Then (N0, N1) forms a (p, \u03bb+)-Vaughtian pair contradicting Corollary 4.8.\n# 5. The Main Result\nNow that we have established the existence of deep-rooted quasi-minimal types with no Vaughtian pairs, we proceed as in [GrVa1] to transfer categoricity upwards using the following result which is a variation of Theorem 4.1 of [GrVa1]. Theorem 5.1. Let \u03bb \u2265\u03c7. Suppose M0 \u2208K\u03bb and r \u2208ga-S(M0) is a quasi-minimal type such that K has no (r, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pairs. Let \u03b1 be an ordinal < \u03bb+ such that \u03b1 = \u03bb \u00b7 \u03b1. Suppose M \u2208K\u03bb has a resolution \u27e8Mi \u2208K\u03bb | i < \u03b1\u27e9such that for every i < \u03b1, there is ci \u2208 Mi+1\\Mi realizing r. Then M is saturated over M0. Moreover if K is Galois-stable in \u03bb, then M is a (\u03bb, \u03b1)-limit model over M0. Proof. At the referee\u2019s request we have included a proof of this result. Let r, M0, M and \u27e8Mi | i < \u03b1\u27e9be as in the statement of the theorem. Let p \u2208ga-S(M0) be given. We will show that M realizes p. First, fix M\u2032 an extension of M0 of cardinality \u03bb realizing p. It is enough to construct an isomorphism between M and some extension of M\u2032. We build such an extension and isomorphism by inductively defining increasing and continuous sequences \u27e8M\u2032 i | i < \u03b1\u27e9and \u27e8hi | i < \u03b1\u27e9so that hi : Mi \u2192M\u2032 i. During this construction we also fix \u27e8a\u03bb\u00b7i+j | j < \u03bb\u27e9an enumeration (possibly repeating) of the realizations of r inside Mi. After stage \u03b2 = \u03bb \u00b7 i + j of the construction, we require that a\u03b2 \u2208h\u03b2+1(M\u03b2+1). To see that such a construction is possible, let us examine the successor case. The base and limit stages of the construction are routine to carry out. Suppose that we have defined M\u2032 i and hi and that we have fixed an enumeration \u27e8a\u03bb\u00b7k+j | j < \u03bb\u27e9of all realizations of r in M\u2032 k for each k \u2264i. By properties of ordinal arithmetic, there is exactly one pair j, k with k \u2264i for which i + 1 = \u03bb \u00b7 k + 1. If ai is already in hi(Mi) there is nothing to do but extend hi to include Mi+1 in its domain and choose an appropriate\n\u22a3\n\u22a3\nM\u2032 i+1 containing hi+1(Mi+1). When ai /\u2208hi(Mi), more care is needed. The important thing to notice here is that in this case, ga-tp(ai/hi(Mi)) is a non-algebraic extension of r. By the quasi-minimality of r, we know that regardless of which extension \u02c7h of hi to an automorphism of C that one would consider, we have ga-tp(\u02c7h(ci)/hi(Mi)) = ga-tp(ai/hi(Mi)). Thus we can choose \u02c7h to be an automorphism of C extending hi so that \u02c7h(ci) = ai. Now define hi+1 := \u02c7h \u21beMi+1 and choose an appropriate extension M\u2032 i+1 of M\u2032 i containing the image of Mi+1 under hi+1. Once we have completed the construction outlined above, the issue of whether or not h := \ufffd i<\u03b1 hi is an isomorphism between M and \ufffd i<\u03b1 M\u2032 i remains to be addressed. First notice that by our assumption that \u03b1 = \u03bb\u00b7\u03b1, if a \u2208M\u2032 realizes r, then at some stage in the construction, we would have put a into the range of h. Therefore, if h were not an isomorphism, h(M) and M\u2032 would form a (r, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pair contradicting our hypothesis on r. If in addition to the hypothesis given, we assume that K is Galois-stable in \u03bb, we could conclude that M is a (\u03bb, \u03b1)-limit model by altering the construction. At stage i of the construction we choose M\u2032 i+1 as above, only now require that M\u2032 i+1 to be universal over M\u2032 i. \u22a3\nM\u2032 i+1 containing hi+1(Mi+1). When ai /\u2208hi(Mi), more care is needed. The important thing to notice here is that in this case, ga-tp(ai/hi(Mi)) is a non-algebraic extension of r. By the quasi-minimality of r, we know that regardless of which extension \u02c7h of hi to an automorphism of C that one would consider, we have ga-tp(\u02c7h(ci)/hi(Mi)) = ga-tp(ai/hi(Mi)). Thus we can choose \u02c7h to be an automorphism of C extending hi so that \u02c7h(ci) = ai. Now define hi+1 := \u02c7h \u21beMi+1 and choose an appropriate extension M\u2032 i+1 of M\u2032 i containing the image of Mi+1 under hi+1. Once we have completed the construction outlined above, the issue of whether or not h := \ufffd i<\u03b1 hi is an isomorphism between M and \ufffd i<\u03b1 M\u2032 i remains to be addressed. First notice that by our assumption that \u03b1 = \u03bb\u00b7\u03b1, if a \u2208M\u2032 realizes r, then at some stage in the construction, we would have put a into the range of h. Therefore, if h were not an isomorphism, h(M) and M\u2032 would form a (r, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pair contradicting our hypothesis on r. If in addition to the hypothesis given, we assume that K is Galois-stable in \u03bb, we could conclude that M is a (\u03bb, \u03b1)-limit model by altering the construction. At stage i of the construction we choose M\u2032 i+1 as above, only now require that M\u2032 i+1 to be universal over M\u2032 i. \u22a3 Using Theorem 5.1, we are able to transfer categoricity from \u03bb to \u03bb+ by showing that every model of cardinality \u03bb+ is saturated: Theorem 5.2. Suppose that K has arbitrarily large models, is \u03c7-tame and satisfies the amalgamation and joint embedding properties. Let \u03bb be such that \u03bb > LS(K) and \u03bb \u2265\u03c7. If K is categorical in \u03bb+ then K is categorical in all \u00b5 \u2265\u03bb+. Proof. First we prove that K is categorical in \u03bb++ by establishing that every model N of cardinality \u03bb++ is saturated. Let M \u227aK N have cardinality \u03bb+. We will show that N realizes every type over M. First notice that Proposition 3.5 and categoricity in \u03bb+ guarantees that there exists a deeprooted quasi-minimal r \u2208ga-S(M). By Corollary 4.9, we know that N realizes r \u03bb++-times. Let \u03b1 < \u03bb+ be such that \u03b1 = \u03bb+ \u00b7 \u03b1. By the Downward-L\u00a8owenheim Skolem Axiom of AECs, we can construct a \u227aK-increasing and continuous chain of models \u27e8Mi \u227aK N | i < \u03b1\u27e9such that M = M0 for every i < \u03b1, we can fix ai \u2208Mi+1\\Mi realizing r. This construction is possible since there are \u03bb++-many realizations of r from which to choose. By Fact 5.1, \ufffd i<\u03b1 Mi realizes every type over M. We have explained that categoricity in \u03bb+ implies categoricity in \u03bb+ and \u03bb++. Now, an application of Fact 1.3 provides categoricity in all larger cardinalities.\nTheorem 5.2. Suppose that K has arbitrarily large models, is \u03c7-tame and satisfies the amalgamation and joint embedding properties. Let \u03bb be such that \u03bb > LS(K) and \u03bb \u2265\u03c7. If K is categorical in \u03bb+ then K is categorical in all \u00b5 \u2265\u03bb+. Proof. First we prove that K is categorical in \u03bb++ by establishing that every model N of cardinality \u03bb++ is saturated. Let M \u227aK N have cardinality \u03bb+. We will show that N realizes every type over M. First notice that Proposition 3.5 and categoricity in \u03bb+ guarantees that there exists a deeprooted quasi-minimal r \u2208ga-S(M). By Corollary 4.9, we know that N realizes r \u03bb++-times. Let \u03b1 < \u03bb+ be such that \u03b1 = \u03bb+ \u00b7 \u03b1. By the Downward-L\u00a8owenheim Skolem Axiom of AECs, we can construct a \u227aK-increasing and continuous chain of models \u27e8Mi \u227aK N | i < \u03b1\u27e9such that M = M0 for every i < \u03b1, we can fix ai \u2208Mi+1\\Mi realizing r. This construction is possible since there are \u03bb++-many realizations of r from which to choose. By Fact 5.1, \ufffd i<\u03b1 Mi realizes every type over M. We have explained that categoricity in \u03bb+ implies categoricity in \u03bb+ and \u03bb++. Now, an application of Fact 1.3 provides categoricity in all larger cardinalities.\nA combination of our upward result and Shelah\u2019s downward result from [Sh 394] yields\nTheorem 5.3. Let K be a \u03c7-tame abstract elementary class satisfying the amalgamation and joint embedding properties. If K is categorical in \u03bb+ for some \u03bb > max{LS(K), \u03c7}, then K is categorical in all \u00b5 \u2265min{\u03bb+, \u2136(2Hanf(K))+}. It remains open whether or not categoricity in \u03bb+ implies categoricity in \u03bb++ for the special case where \u21350 < LS(K) = \u03c7 = \u03bb. For this case, a substitute for Fact 4.2 is missing. We will provide some partial results concerning this problem in the following section.\nTheorem 5.3.

For this case, a substitute for Fact 4.2 is missing. We will provide some partial results concerning this problem in the following section.\n6. Categoricity in LS(K) and LS(K)+\nIn this section, we examine an abstract elementary class which is categorical in both \u03bb and \u03bb+ and \u03bb = LS(K) = \u03c7. We assume the class has no maximal models and satisfies the amalgamation and joint embedding properties. This is motivated by questions of John Baldwin and Olivier Lessmann concerning perceived limitations of [GrVa1]. From these assumptions, we derive categoricity in all \u00b5 \u2265LS(K). The difficulty in working with a class that is categorical in LS(K)+ is that there are no saturated models of cardinality LS(K). However, from stability we do have limit models of cardinality LS(K), and in this section we have an extra categoricity assumption which tells us that all models of cardinality LS(K), while not saturated, are limit models. This allows us to use minimal types instead of quasi-minimal types. We begin with a replacement for Fact 4.2. Theorem 6.1. Assume that K is categorical in \u03bb and \u03bb+ with \u03bb = LS(K) = \u03c7. Then for every limit model M \u2208K\u03bb there is a minimal type p \u2208ga-S(M), such that there are no true (p, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pairs of the form (N0, N1) with M = N0. Proof. Suppose every minimal type over a limit model had a true Vaughtian pair. Let M be a limit model of cardinality \u00b5 and fix p \u2208ga-S(M) minimal with true Vaughtian pair (M, N1) where N1 \u2208K\u03bb. We can construct a \u227aKincreasing and continuous chain \u27e8Ni | i < \u03bb+\u27e9of limit models such that for each i < \u03bb+ (1) N0 = M (2) Ni \u2208K\u03bb (3) Ni is a limit model and (4) no a \u2208Ni+1\\Ni realizes p. Suppose i is a limit ordinal and that we have defined Nj for all j < i. Let Ni := \ufffd j<i Nj. By categoricity in \u03bb we know that Ni must be a limit model (but it may not be a limit model over M). For the successor step of the construction, suppose that Ni has been defined. Since M is a limit model, we can find pi \u2208ga-S(Ni) a unique nonalgebraic extension of p (by Remark 3.4). Since Ni is a limit model and pi is a minimal type, by our assumption it must be the case that there is Ni+1 a limit model extending Ni which together with Ni forms a (pi, \u03bb)-Vaughtian\npair. Since no a \u2208Ni+1\\Ni realizes pi, we can conclude by the minimality of p that condition (4) holds. To see why the construction is enough to get a contradiction, let N\u03bb+ := \ufffd i<\u03bb+ Ni. From condition (4) of the construction, we find that N\u03bb+ does not realize p. Thus N\u03bb+ is not saturated, which contradicts categoricity in \u03bb+. \u22a3\nWe now prove a slight variation of Corollary 4.8.\nCorollary 6.2. Let \u03bb be as in Theorem 6.1. For every M \u2208K\u03bb+, there is q \u2208ga-S(M), a deep-rooted minimal type with no (q, \u03bb+)-Vaughtian pairs.\nProof. Let M \u2208K\u03bb+ be given. Fix N \u227aK M a limit model of cardinality \u03bb. By Theorem 6.1, we can choose a minimal p \u2208ga-S(N) such that there are no true (p, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pairs. By Proposition 3.5, we can extend p to a deep-rooted minimal type q \u2208ga-S(M). Suppose that N 0, N 1 form a (q, \u03bb+)-Vaughtian pair. Then Theorem 4.4 and Remark 4.7 tell us that there are limit models N0, N1 with N \u227aK N0 \u227aK N 0 with (N0, N1) a (p, \u03bb)Vaughtian pair and N0 a limit model over N. Furthermore, we have that (N0, N1) form a (q \u21beN0, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pair. We will now show that by our choice of p such (q \u21beN0, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pairs cannot exist. Since N is a limit model, we can find a resolution \u27e8N + i | i < \u03c9\u27e9 of N such that N + i+1 is universal over N + i . By Fact 2.9, there is i < \u03c9 such that p does not \u03bb-split over N + i . Observe that N is a limit model over N + i . Additionally, since N0 is a limit model over N it is also a limit model over N + i . Then, N and N0 are isomorphic over N + i . Let f : N \u223c= N0 with f \u21beN + i = idN+ i . Since there are no (p, \u03bb)-Vaughtian pairs with N as the first model in the pair, there are no (f(p), \u03bb)-Vaughtian pairs with N0 as the first model in the pair. By invariance and our choice of N + i , we have that f(p) does not \u00b5-spit over N + i . This implies that f(p) \u2265p, otherwise f \u22121 would witness that f(p) \u03bb-splits over N + i . Now we have that f(p) and q \u21beN0 are both non-algebraic extensions of p to N0. By minimality of p, f(p) = q \u21beN0 and we can conclude that there are no (q \u21beN0)-Vaughtian pairs with N0 as the first model of the pair. This gives us a contradiction and completes the proof. \u22a3\nCorollary 6.2 is enough to carry out the argument of Corollary 4.9 and the remaining arguments in Section 5. This allows us to conclude the second theorem in the abstract, restated here:\nTheorem 6.3. Let K be a LS(K)-tame abstract elementary class satisfying the amalgamation and joint embedding properties with arbitrarily large models. If K is categorical in both LS(K) and LS(K)+, then K is categorical in all \u00b5 \u2265LS(K).\n# References\n[Ba1] John Baldwin. Categoricity. Monograph, in preparation.

    "paper_type": "theory",
    "attri": {
        "background": "This paper addresses the issue of categoricity in abstract elementary classes (AECs) and extends Shelah's Categoricity Conjecture by proving that from categoricity in \u03bb+ one can derive categoricity in all cardinals \u2265 \u03bb+ in \u03c7-tame AECs with arbitrarily large models that satisfy the amalgamation and joint embedding properties.",
        "problem": {
            "definition": "The core problem is to establish the conditions under which categoricity in one successor cardinal implies categoricity in all larger cardinals within the framework of \u03c7-tame abstract elementary classes.",
            "key obstacle": "The main challenge lies in proving the upward transfer of categoricity without relying on additional set-theoretic assumptions."
        },
        "idea": {
            "intuition": "The idea was inspired by previous works that established connections between categoricity in various cardinals, particularly in the context of AECs.",
            "opinion": "The authors propose that under certain conditions, notably the presence of tameness, it is possible to transfer categoricity upwards from one successor cardinal to all larger cardinals.",
            "innovation": "The primary innovation of this work is the introduction of deep-rooted quasi-minimal types, which allow for the establishment of categoricity without the need for maximal models."
        },
        "Theory": {
            "perspective": "The theoretical perspective is rooted in model theory, particularly in the study of abstract elementary classes and their categoricity properties.",
            "opinion": "The authors assume that the properties of tameness and amalgamation are sufficient to derive significant results about categoricity.",
            "proof": "The proof involves demonstrating that categoricity in \u03bb+ leads to the existence of saturated models in larger cardinalities, leveraging the properties of quasi-minimal types."
        },
        "experiments": {
            "evaluation setting": "The evaluation is based on the framework of \u03c7-tame AECs with properties such as amalgamation and joint embedding, focusing on the cardinality conditions of models.",
            "evaluation method": "The authors employ theoretical proofs and constructions of models to show the implications of categoricity across different cardinals."
        },
        "conclusion": "The conclusion of the paper is that if an AEC is categorical in \u03bb+, it is also categorical in all cardinals greater than or equal to \u03bb+, provided it satisfies the necessary structural properties.",
        "discussion": {
            "advantage": "The main advantage of this work is the clarification of the conditions under which categoricity can be transferred, which simplifies the understanding of AECs.",
            "limitation": "A limitation noted is the reliance on the presence of tameness and the absence of maximal models, which may not hold in all cases.",
            "future work": "Future work could explore the implications of these results in broader contexts and investigate whether similar results can be derived without the assumption of tameness."
