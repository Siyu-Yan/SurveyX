You will be provided with a segment of text from a survey paper. This text describes a series of methods or theories. Your task is to extract **three representative and appropriately abstract attributes** and provide a **brief description** for each attribute. The attributes and descriptions should meet the following criteria:  

1. **Representative**: The attributes must capture the key characteristics of the methods or theories.  
2. **Descriptive**: Each attribute must be accompanied by a clear, concise description of its meaning.  
3. **Abstract**: The attributes should be sufficiently abstract to accommodate diverse content in the text. Avoid overly specific attributes and prefer generalized terms, such as *"Structural Features"*, *"Task Type"*, or *"Applicable Scenarios"*.  
4. **Concise**: Each attribute name must be **no longer than three words**.  
5. **Limited to three**: Provide exactly three attributes and their corresponding descriptions.  

Output your results in the following dictionary format:  
{{
    'Attribute1': 'XXX',
    'Description1': 'XXX',
    'Attribute2': 'XXX',
    'Description2': 'XXX',
    'Attribute3': 'XXX',
    'Description3': 'XXX'
}}
Please strictly follow the output format requirements.

Your response should be enclosed within `<Answer>` and `</Answer>` tags.

Example Output:
```
<Answer>
{{
    'Attribute1': 'XXX',
    'Description1': 'XXX',
    'Attribute2': 'XXX',
    'Description2': 'XXX',
    'Attribute3': 'XXX',
    'Description3': 'XXX'
