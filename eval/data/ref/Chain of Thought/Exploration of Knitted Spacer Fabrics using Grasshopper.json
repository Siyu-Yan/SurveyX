We show this approach in action for the exploration of weft-knitted spacer fabrics. The modelling tools are readily available and represent a fast-growing approach in communities of generative design. The approach helps solving the problem that spacer fabrics are complex structures which are hard to imagine and to visualize.

In the next paragraph we shall give more characteristics of each, but the  important observation is that, for a variety of reasons, this is not a smooth spectrum, but a spectrum with  a somewhat difficult space in the middle.  Industrial knitting is a well-established industry which began in 1589 when the English  Reverend William Lee invented the weft-knitting machine with a 16-fold greater productivity than a  manual knitter (Schrank et al., 2014).  Between 1802 and 1806 Pierre Jeandeau is said to have invented  the first latch needle (Hawkins), in 1816 Marc Brunel, arranged the needles in a circular form (Hawkins),  and in 1878 Griswold added a second set of needles to the top of circular knitting machine (Hawkins).  The American Civil War (1861-1865) and the 1st World War (1914-1918) gave enormous boosts to  industrial knitting (Hawkins).  The global knitted fabrics market reached a value of nearly $55.8 billion in 2018, having grown  at a compound annual growth rate of 2.1% since 2014, and is expected to grow at  4.6% to nearly $66.9  billion by 2022 (Research and Markets 2019). The knitted fabrics form the second largest market  segment of fabrics (31.7%) coming after woven fabrics (45.7%) (Research and Markets 2019).  These fabrics are used to make garments for a global market which is huge: the Global Knitwear  market is anticipated to reach USD 699 Billion, growing at a rate of over 5% due to increasing ecommerce and expanding fashion industry (TechSci, 2021). Moreover, rising awareness about health  and increased participation in activities, such as running and yoga, are elevating the demand for active  wear. Based on the product type, the market has been segmented into Innerwear, T-Shirts & Shirts,  Sweaters & Jackets, Sweatshirts & Hoodies, Shorts & Trousers, Evening Dresses, Suits, and Leggings  & Accessories. In 2019, t-shirts, shirts and innerwear acquired more than 40% share which is anticipated  to increase in the future (TechSci, 2021).  Industrial knitting relies heavily on the knitting machine industry, which produces the  sophisticated knitting machines based on two centuries of development. The market for industrial  machines is dominated by a few heritage brands from Germany and Japan, notably Stoll (Germany) and  Shima Seiki (Japan), both for flat knitting, Karl Mayer (Germany), Fukuhara (Japan), Monarch (USA),  and Santoni (Italy). Many smaller companies are active from Spain, Taiwan, China, and so on. This  industry tends to protect its intellectual properties by patents, for example Espacenet gives 764 hits for \n2 Corresponding author: Loe Feijs, Studio LAURENTIUS LAB., Sittard, The Netherlands, and Department of Industrial Design, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e), The Netherlands, l.m.g.feijs@tue.nl \nknitting and Stoll, 759 for knitting and Karl Mayer (5 overlaps as Karl Mayer has bought Stoll in 2020),  2.469 for knitting and Shima Seiki. The market for knitting machines was 6.8 billion in 2018 and is  expected to grow to 10.8 billion in 2027 (Credence, 2021).  In the last decades, computer technology has become an essential part of knitting design and  industrial production: there are embedded microcontrollers inside the machines, controlling all moving  parts, and there is CAD software for designing the knitted fabric structure, the color patterns, and the  panel layouts. Most file formats are proprietary and the software is expensive. Besides the abovementioned dominant heritage brands, there are many small companies active in knitting, witnessed by  thousands of patents addressing specialized applications such as shoes (for example)  Home knitting has always been widely popular and still is today. With just a few simple knitting  needles, almost any garment can be knitted, which means that anyone can begin learning and practicing  knitting without initial investment (except for an investment in time). There are also affordable knitting  machines for home usage, although these are sold in much lower numbers than home sewing machines  \u2500 many Brother machines are still around, although Brother stopped producing them in the late 1990s,  and there are Chinese clones (BrotherWiki).  Nowadays, there is a shift in purpose however. Until one  or two generations ago, knitting was a necessity for low income families to have warm garments for the  cold season. During long winter evenings, as outdoor work was difficult, the women would knit socks,  gloves, sweaters, vests, and hats for their husband, children and grandchildren.   Nowadays, the main purpose is creative expression (BrotherWiki), making special garments  with special patterns: attractive items which are much more personal than the ready-mades from  industry. For many types of products, it isn\u2019t a matter of cost anymore, it is often cheaper to buy a mass  manufactured product. Techniques and patterns are widespread and readily available from friends,  knitting magazines, websites and Youtube movies. The community website Ravelry has about 9 million  registered users, and approximately 1 million monthly active users. Sustainability and social  considerations play a role too, for example working with wool from local farmers, well-cared sheep,  recycling of yarn, and so on.  Between industrial knitting and home knitting there is a creative space with lots of possibilities  but also lots of difficulties. It is a space populated by specialized artists, exceptional amateurs, museums,  graduation students, and tiny companies. The possibilities are endless: any structure, any form, no matter  how small or how large can be knitted. There are connections to the fab-lab movement; indeed, there is  an abundance of small-scale projects bringing home-knitting machines under Arduino control,  combining knitwear with electronics, in the same physical spaces and communities where also lasercutters, 3D printers, semi-automated looms and so on are combined. But the complexity of knitting  itself, the time-consuming nature of manual or semi-automated knitting, and the proprietary file formats  make it difficult to connect to the power of the industrial machines. It is in this in-between space that  the project we report in this paper took place.  The carrier for our exploration was designing spacer fabrics, but similar situations and  opportunities arise for other knitted structures. The difficulty of knitted spacer fabrics is that they need  a double-bed machine in order to get high-quality results, and there is no way to prototype the  construction using hand needles, for example. In an industrial production setting, samples would be  made, mechanical properties measured in a dedicated lab, and after a lot of (expensive) exploration, the  structure would go into (mass) production, the initial lab costs being recovered by the profit of  significant turnovers. In our case, as in most fab-labs, the driving force is curiosity: can we make this?  Can we push the limits further? Can we connect to other creatives? This is where we spotted an  opportunity to import a modelling approach from the world of 3D printing, where it is central to  \u201cgenerative design\u201d. In particular, we use Grasshopper, a 3D programming language, which is quite  unique in the landscape of CAD tools and programming languages. We use it to explore and understand  the structure of our knitted spacer fabrics, for which otherwise it is very hard to see what is going on  inside and almost impossible to explain to others. \n# What is Grasshopper? \nGrasshopper (www.grasshopper3d.com) is a graphical programming language for building 3D  structures. Unlike most other programming languages such as Java, Javascript, Matlab, Mathematica,  and Python, the program logic is described by connecting basic building blocks in an interactive and  graphical way. A similar way of programming was pioneered in MAX/MSP before, which is popular  among music composers (Manzo, 2016). In Grasshopper, each building block performs a simple task,  for example replicating an object multiple times, translating or rotating an object, drawing a line between  two points, and so on. There are also sliders so it becomes easy to play with parameters. This feature  enables a design approach known as \u201cparametric design\u201d or \u201cgenerative design\u201d.  The language was  developed by David Rutten working at Robert McNeel & Associates. Grasshopper is not stand-alone, it  is a plug-in for Rhino, a traditional 3D CAD tool (Becker and Golay, 1999). Rhino already had a large  user base, mostly in mechanical engineering, before Grasshopper was added. Rhino had no built-in  notion of material or material properties (Unlike Solid-works), but its objects were defined by surfaces,  surfaces in turn being defined by lines, and lines by points. In its core, the main mechanism under the  hood of Rhino is the mathematical description of smooth curves called NURBS (Rogers, 2001),  somewhat like the popular B\u00e9zier curves, but more versatile. Rhino is often used as a what-you-see-iswhat-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor of 3D structures. The fortunate circumstance was that Rhino came  with a scripting API, which enabled Rutten\u2019s step of putting Grasshopper on top of it. Figure 1 shows  two windows, one for Rhino and one for Grasshopper, working together. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/533f/533fd28b-e5b3-4262-9760-a320a210e592.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1.

The two views are connected in the sense that some of the  WYSIWYG-made objects (lines, curves, surfaces, 3D objects) are fed as input to some of the  Grasshopper components. It is also possible to see the output of the Grasshopper component network in  the same 3D world of Rhino, or add them by a step called \u201cbaking\u201d.  Grasshopper is deployed in several application domains which vary widely in scale. It is used  for city planning (Krishnamurti, 2012), for architecture (Gogolkina, 2018), for product design (Sun,  2019), and for mathematical art (Godthelp, 2019). In case of product design, the production methods are  typically 3D printing, CNC milling and laser cutting.  \n# What are spacer fabrics?\nAccording to (Spencer, 2001) (chapter 30, section 10): \u201cA spacer fabric is a double-faced fabric knitted on a double needle bar machine. The distance between the two surfaces is retained after compression by the resilience of the pile yarn (usually mono-filament) that passes between them.\u201d Typical applications include body protection, mattresses, sportswear, car interiors, seats, and shoe soles. Spacer fabrics are an alternative to rubber, foam and natural filler materials with potential advantages of being lighter, more permeable for air, less prone to retain moisture, more environment-friendly, and more stable over time. We show the main idea in Figure 2. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/48f2/48f2b9ca-715a-44af-8cc7-9a3b5e15cd15.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 2. Sketch of spacer fabric with upper and lower face and pile yarns (\u201cspacers\u201d) in between.  Spacer fabrics have been  an active area of invention for about 15 years. The plot in Figure 3 shows t number of patent applications on the query \u201cspacer\u201d and \u201cfabric\u201d in Espacenet (own research, Janua 2021).  \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/405f/405f0e14-07ac-4367-9013-c530df984c30.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3. Spacer fabric patents from 1990-2020.</div>\nAs for all of knitting, there are two main types of structures (Spencer, Chapter 6): warp knitting (usually  on circular machines) (Spencer, Chapter 7) and weft knitting (either by hand or on flat bed machines)  (Spencer, Chapter 23). Here we work with weft knitting, but similar work could be done for warp  knitting as well.  The design of spacer fabrics is difficult for several reasons. One reason is that it is hard to see  what is going on during production, because of the high-speed of the automated machines, and the small  scale of the knit structure itself. Unlike traditional knitted fabrics, the most interesting part of the wafer  fabric is inside and hard to analyze without cutting into the fabrics (which would change the parameters \nimmediately). There are various dynamic effects such as the stretching of the fabric when inside the machine followed by relaxation once the fabric comes off the needles. And of course there is the dynamic effect during usage that the monofilaments resist, bend or buckle when under pressure, which is what eventually gives rise to the desired (or undesired in case of buckling) transversal elastic properties (Bruer, 2005). Despite the difficulties, the design space is large (it is already large for nonspacer knitting). It\u2019s not just the material properties of the pile yarns which matter, but also how they are positioned: vertical, or more skewed? Left-right or also in the longitudinal direction, or both? At which spacing? It should be noted that the position of the pile yarns (also called spacers) cannot be chosen arbitrarily, but has to be aligned with the upper and lower fabric by appropriate stitches.  It is a huge puzzle, and for the designer, seeing the \u201cpuzzle pieces\u201d in front of his/her very eyes is vital for making progress. \n# Approach\nOne question, which was the starting point of deploying Grasshopper to visualize spacer fabrics, was  what would be an effective ratio of the horizontal (left-right) and vertical (longitudinal) spacer distances?  There was an intuitive hope to find some kind of simple formula, 4:8 perhaps, or another simple ratio  hat would work best. This was also the point where the two authors met, one being an experienced  reative knitter, the other having a background in design and engineering. Knitting is a very technical  ubject area with its own language, so one of us had to go through a steep learning curve.    After lots of exploration and discussion on what type of model would be both feasible and useful, a  modelling approach emerged, based on the following choices:  1. Level of detail: we abstract from the yarn deformations which happen inside each stitch, yet we  do make the stitches visible and we allow for stretching of an entire course or wale of stitches.  2. Programming versus WYSIWYG: we describe the shape of a basic loop, a float stitch and a  tuck stitch as a curved line in Rhino; the fabric itself is then described by Grasshopper operations  using appropriate components for repetition, counting, translation, and so on.  3. Stretching and raising: the interplay of the fabric stretch and the arising of inter-panel distance,  which is the core mechanism why a spacer fabric does make space, should be modeled explicitly  in the core of the model. Other features can be added in an on-need manner, once the core is  understood.  4. Visualization and animation: we give thickness and color to the lines of the stitches and spacer  yarns to make sure that the fabric looks realistic and natural and that thus the entire model  becomes a communication tool. All the Rhino view options (Becker and Golay, 1999) are  available, so by mouse interaction, the user can pan, zoom and rotate the entire model in a virtual  3D space, which is most helpful to see the structure (much better than frozen renderings).  Moreover the key model parameters are obtained from sliders, so the user can play with the  model. The sliders can also be connected to a timer, in which case an animation is generated. \n# The core model\nWe describe the core of our model by showing the Rhino views of one and the same model in two  different states, obtained by choosing two different values for the krimp parameter (meaning shrink,  which can be manipulated through a slider). There are two layers of weft knitted panels, which we call  the upper and the lower panel. There is one spacer yarn, shown yellow, which in reality would be a stiff  monofilament, which is connected to both panels by tuck stitches. After each tuck, the spacer yarn floats  for two stitches and then it is tucked in the opposite panel, and so on. In practice there will be many  more such spacer yarns, but here we just show one, for simplicity. Whereas in Figure 4, the default  shrink factor is 1.0, in Figure 5 it is 0.98. Shrinking means releasing the stretch which is naturally builtin to each panel because of the knitting machine\u2019s working. In the model this is done by a horizontal \nscaling of each panel, simply multiplying the inter-stitch distance by 0.98 (which is fed into translation and repetition components of Grasshopper). The tuck stitch is modelled rigid and so is the straight-line segment of the spacer yarn. Only at the connection of the tuck and the straight line, the spacer yarn flexes (in the model). \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/37eb/37eb5331-dc56-4dc6-8f22-8d5894a252cf.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4.

Spacer fabric with one course of horizontal spacers (yellow) with panels (blue, green) stretched. </div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4. Spacer fabric with one course of horizontal spacers (yellow) with panels (blue, green) stretched.  This shows the core principle why the panels are moved apart. In physical reality, this happens by the elasticity of the panels and the stiffness of the spacer yarns, which push and pull against each other  near the tuck stitches. Other subtle details could be modelled as well, like how the panel stretches by  either elasticity in the weft yarns or loop deformations, and all kinds of friction or play.  </div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/a521/a5218b95-1735-4385-b800-6a83fa3f5646.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 5. Spacer fabric with one course of horizontal spacers after shrinking of the panel</div>\nSo the space between the panels depends on the horizontal stitch width, the shrink factor, and the length  of the spacer yarn floats. The latter length, which in reality is determined during knitting (when the interpanel distance is minimal), depends on the number of missed stitches of the spacer yarn\u2019s float. We  considered two possibilities to model this mechanism of panels being pushed apart: \n1. To use a special physics engine plug-in to Grasshopper. There is one such engine which is gaining popularity in architecture (e.g. for free-form hanging roofs), called Kangaroo (Piker, 2013). We could deploy it to define joints, constraints, anchors, and elasticities and see the resulting distance emerge from the iterative equations solver inside Kangaroo.  2. To figure out the equations between the key parameters ourselves and transform the equations into a computation. For the latter computation, there would again be two options: a) model all numeric multiplications, additions etc. by Grasshopper components, one for each operator, or b) write them as a formula and embed the formula as a mini-Python program in a single Grasshopper block (indeed, there are many plug-ins, Python being one of them).  We took the second option: once we saw the configurations in early models, similar to Figure 4 and 5, and having played with a few parameter settings it became clear that essentially the distances involved are related by equations based on Pythagoras\u2019 law. No iterative solver is needed and we felt it would be beneficial to have simple equations rather than an outcome emerging by magic from a solver. We began with sub-option 2a; later, when working with spacers in two directions, we switched to option 2b.  The equations are explained using Figure 6, which is based on 14 Gauge knitting (Gauge simply refers to the number of stitches a garment has per inch.). Referring to Figure 6, we recognize two rectangular triangles, one with sides Ai , Bi , and Ci (subscript i for initial), the other with sides A , B and C. The former describes the initial condition, when the just-knitted fragment of each panel is still on the needles. We have Ai = m \u00d7 H, and Bi  is assumed given as the distance between the two beds of the knitting machine. Then \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 follows by Pythagoras\u2019 law \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= \ufffd(\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)2 + (\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)2. When the stitches come off the needles, they shrink by a factor we call \u03c3 (for example 0.98 in Figure 5). In the new situation, A = \u03c3 \u00d7 m \u00d7 H, and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36= \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (because the spacer is considered rigid). Now B follows from Pythagoras, working backwards, and thus we find the inter-panel distance as  \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35= \u221a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc362 \u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc342 .   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/dd2c/dd2cd07f-b086-4c3e-b4da-909b690a111b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\nThis core model is the basis of more refined studies, where the same style of modelling is used again  and again. Although more parameters play a role, the equations stay of the same type: no real new  hurdle is encountered. It would be outside the scope of this paper to describe all refinements we did,  but we summarize them in one of the next sections (Section extensions and experiences). \n# Language aspects\nIt is important to point out that the models, of which Figures 4 and 5 are screenshots, are not handcrafted. They are the output of a parametric Grasshopper program, which has been assembled as a network of sliders, repetition components, arithmetic components, mesh pipe components, coloring components etc. To give an impression of the complexity of the network, we include Figure 7. It is easy to build-up such a network, connecting each component\u2019s inputs to other components\u2019 outputs by straightforward drag and drop. It is slightly more difficult, however, to read the program back after a while, or explain it to someone else. That\u2019s why we took great care to add comments and group the components such as to suggest a logical flow of the data. Moreover, we adopted a helpful color scheme. The pink zone in Figure 7 is about elementary in-course distances such as the gauge and the shrink factor, whereas the dark grey zone is about inter-course distances. The blue flow is for the lower panel, the green flow for the upper panel; the yellow flow is for the spacer yarn (in other words, we give the program\u2019s land areas the same colors as the yarns themselves, i.e. the colors seen in Figures 4, 5, 6). \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/6b05/6b058509-8cdb-48b6-a3d2-b8aca7ca9b24.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 7. Overview of the core Grasshopper model.</div>\nIn an ideal world, this description could be automatically linked to the existing CAD tools for knitting  such as provided by Stoll and Shima Seiki, which are needed anyhow to design the stitches and program  the machine (in our case a Stoll ADF830-24W flat bed knitting machine and ). The world is far from  ideal, however. Most professional knitting software is rather closed, and it is even doubtful whether  machine programming and fabric simulation can or should be all in one model (mostly likely it would  be too complex to learn and manage). For the time being we work with a patchwork of tools,  Grasshopper now being one more patch. \n# Extensions and experiences\nIn addition to the horizontal spacers (aligned along the direction parallel to the courses, like the yellow  yarns in Figures 4 and 5), we studied and realized fabrics which also include vertical spacers (in the  orthogonal direction, parallel to the wales). From the Grasshopper model we understood that both types  of spacers have the effect of pushing the panels outwards, but that they need careful alignment to make  sure that they push to the same distance, rather than work against each other (which would weaken the  structure). Playing with the models, and building upon the equations given before, we could make the  equilibrium condition explicit: \nHere, m, H and \u03c3 are the parameters of the horizontal spacers and n, V and \u03c4 are the corresponding parameters of the vertical spacers. When the vertical spacers are not fully vertical, because they mus shift by one tuck stitch each hop, we get a slightly more complicated equilibrium condition, but in essence, the approach still works. We also explored the tensions in the spacer yarns under non equilibrium conditions: we animated refined models where the yarns get thinner and show red spot when stretched (Grasshopper allows the tube widths and mesh colors to be defined by computation and thus change dynamically).  Another open problem which was hard to answer otherwise was whether the horizontal and vertica spacers would interfere with each during the relaxation phase, or perhaps would collide for an impossibl cross-over. This question could be solved by an animated version of several models with differen combinations of m and n.  We found that this type of modelling opens the gate to developing a number of insights and  possibilities: \n\u25cf Visualization of the internal structure and better understanding of the internal mechanisms of  complex fabrics, such as the equilibrium formula given above. Some of the insights correspond  to insights found experimentally by other spacer fabric researchers (see section related work),  others are new.  \u25cf Improved communication with specialists and non-specialists to share and exchange ideas. In  particular, screenshots and animation movies were helpful in a project where a knitter (the first  author) and a weaver (MV) cooperate with different fabric construction methods to develop  innovative spacer fabrics.  \u25cf The fact that we had a mathematical model, triggered another research line, viz. to perform  stress-displacement tests. Although we have not reached the point where we have agreement  between theory and lab-tests, the discussion of quantitative experimental effects not seen in the  model (e.g. the negative resistance) is very stimulating for studying more literature and is helpful  to refine our language of mechanisms and effects.   \u25cf The approach helps to connect the process of knitting innovation to other innovation processes,  which happen in typical fab-lab environments, where 3D printing, electronics, laser-cutting,  computerized embroidery, programming, etc. are creatively mixed. We envisage combinations  of knitting, 3D printing and/or electronics, similar towhere embroidery, 3D printing and  electronics are combined (Goudswaard et al., 2020) . Designing such combinations will be  facilitated by the shared language and shared models, as Rhino/Grasshopper is used for 3D  printing anyhow. \nWe began harvesting the first, second and third of these two advantages. The fourth is so far only a vision and in that sense it is speculative. We believe however this vision to be very promising, in particular for those who work in the creative space between industrial knitting and home knitting. \n# Related work\nThe mechanism described in Section the core model is precisely what is explained by (Liu and Hu, 2011), who conclude that elasticity in the panel yarns causes the panels to be pushed apart by the spacer yarns. As Liu and Hu explain \u201cThe reason is that high shrinkage of the nylon/spandex covered yarn causes the surface loop wales to come more close after the fabric is removed from the machine and this leads to a higher inclination angle of the spacer yarns.\u201d They conclude that the thickness of the spacer fabric is not just a matter of the machine properties, but depends on elasticity of the panel yarns and on a number NP (spacer stitch loop length, similar to our n). Lui and Hu: \u201cSo, it is possible to knit spacer fabrics with different thicknesses using elastic yarns for the outer layers on the same flat knitting machine.\u201d  In the stress-displacement test we found areas with negative slope, which is a kind of (differential) negative resistance, also described by (Chen, Hu and Liu, 2015). The core model does not\nexplain that (yet), but our hypothesis is that the monofilament spacer yarns go into an S-form: once in S-form they lose their beam nature and work as springs of lower stiffness. The S-forms (and other types of buckling) could be added to our Grasshopper models using the Kangaroo plugin (Piker, 2013).   (Guo, Long, Sun and Zhao, 2013) develop models similar to ours, but working in Matlab. Like we did, they study the effect of the spacer yarn inclination angle on fabric properties. Their inclination angle is the same as arctan( B/A ) in our model. They study certain combinations of horizontal and vertical spacers but do not derive equilibrium formulas. \n# Discussion and conclusions\nThere is still a lot of work to be done in modelling, testing and verification of the structures and properties of spacer yarns. Our approach has some overlap with other modelers such as (Liu and Hu, 2011), (Chen, Hu and Liu, 2015) and (Guo, Long, Sun and Zhao, 2013). Whereas these researchers are ahead of us in their experimental lab work, we can still claim certain advantages of our approach. The main advantage is the transparency of the models, which gives insightful 3D models parameterized by convenient sliders and easy to manipulate by pan, zoom and rotate options. The Grasshopper models are flexible and easily tunable to a wide variety of research questions. Another advantage is that the Grasshopper community is open; documentation, help and tricks are widely available. The plugin is readily available, and students get free temporary Rhino licences. Our approach helps to open up the world of knitting towards fab-labs and open-source communities and thus foster cooperation beyond the boundaries of knitting. \n# Declaration of Conflicting Interests \nThe author(s) declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article. \n# Funding\nThe work described in this project was partially done in the The Space Between project supported by  the WORTH Partnership Project of the European Commission under COSME.  \n# References\n(Hawkins)  Mary Hawkins, A Short History of Machine Knitting,  Knitting History Forum,  http://knittinghistory.co.uk/resources (retrieved 1-2-2021) \n (Manzo 2016) Manzo, V.
