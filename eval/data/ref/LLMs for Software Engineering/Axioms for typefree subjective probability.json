This notion is normally conceived of, either explicitly or implicitly, in a typed way, i.e., as applying to propositions that do not contain the concept of subjective rational probability itself. But formal epistemologists are becoming increasingly interested in typefree (or reflexive) subjective rational probability. From a logical point of view, the following urgent question then presents itself:\n# What are basic logical calculi governing typefree subjective rational probability?\nThis is the question that we discuss in this article. Since we want to have natural ways of constructing self-referential sentences at our disposal (in particular the diagonal lemma), we will formalise subjective probability as a (two-place) predicate rather than as a sentential operator, as is the more common practice in confirmation theory and formal epistemology. Our predicate expresses a functional relation between sentences on the one hand, and rational or real numbers on the other hand. The target notion will be the familiar concept of subjective rational probability. This is in contrast with some other recent work on self-referential probability (such as [3] and [18]) in which a semantic concept of probability is targeted. Moreover, in this article we insist on classical logic governing this subjective probability predicate: first-order classical logic will be relied on throughout. It should not, perhaps, be assumed that there is a single correct elementary theory of typefree subjective rational probability. Maybe we should instead look for basic calculi that occupy a significant place in a landscape of possible background theories of typefree subjective probability. Surprisingly, this field is wide open. But this question is important. In order to obtain solid and general results in formal epistemology, rigorous axiomatic frameworks in which controversial epistemological rules and principles are studied, are needed. We present and discuss two such calculi: one for finitely additive probability, and one for \u03c3-additive probability. We do not claim that these are the only interesting elementary systems of typefree subjective probability that can be thought of. We investigate some of the proof-theoretic properties of these systems, motivated by an analogy with certain typefree truth theories. We will see that the elementary system for finitely additive probability that we propose can be seen as a minimal system of typefree subjective probability, whereas the elementary system for \u03c3-additive probability that we propose can be seen as a maximal system of typefree subjective probability. In a concluding section, we take some first steps in the investigation of controversial epistemic principles against the background of these basic formal calculi. In our investigation, we will exploit the analogy between probability and truth: the property of truth is to some extent similar to, albeit of course not identical to, the property of having probability 1. Also, subjective probability can be seen as a quantitative version of the qualitative notion of justified belief. So the theory of reflexive justified belief also contains lessons for the theory of typefree subjective probability. Our aim is to develop calculi that are in a sense elementary. In particular, we want to keep the languages that we work with as simple as pos-\nsible. The only non-logico-mathematical symbol will be one for subjective rational probability (Pr). In this sense, we focus in this article on the pure calculus of typefree subjective probability. Thus we work in a more austere environment than some recent work in this area, in which the relation between truth and probability is investigated in a typefree context (such as [17] and [18]). This does not mean that we find these richer frameworks in any way objectionable. But we believe that having a robust sense of what is possible in an austere setting is valuable for research into typefree probability in more expressive settings. Likewise we have of course no objection whatsoever against enriching the language of typefree subjective probability with empirical predicates, although we will not have much to say about that in the sequel. The technical results in this article must be classed as basic. Most of the propositions and theorems are obtained by adapting arguments in the literature for analogous arguments for axiomatic theories of related notions, such as truth, justification, believability. Our aim here is merely to contribute to the groundwork of the theory of typefree subjective probability: much work remains to be done.\n# 2 Paradox?\nWe will try to exploit, to some extent, the analogy between having subjective rational probability 1, on the one hand, and being true, on the other hand. Since we are interested in typefree probability, the analogy will be with typefree truth. Typefree truth is a notion that is known to be prone to paradox: intuitive principles (the unrestricted Tarski-biconditionals) lead to a contradiction. What about type-free (subjective) probability? Two important principles from the literature on axiomatic truth are Factivity and Necessitation. Factivity is the schematic axiom that says that if A is true, then A; Necessitation is the following schematic inference rule: From a proof of A, infer that A is true. From the literature on axiomatic truth, we know that Factivity and Necessitation together yield a contradiction. This is known as the Kaplan-Montague paradox:1 it is a mild strengthening of the liar paradox. The literature on typefree truth theories shows that typefree truth theories divide roughly into two families: FriedmanSheard-like (FS-like) theories and Kripke-Feferman-like (KF-like) theories. This can be seen as a reflection on whether Factivity or the rule of Neces-\nsitation ought to be rejected: FS rejects Factivity, and KF rejects Necessitation.2 For typefree subjective probability, all this means that there is a prima facie reason for being at the same time worried and cautiously hopeful. The basic axioms for subjective rational probability are Kolmogorov\u2019s axioms3 for being a finitely additive probability function. One of Kolmogorov\u2019 principles says that necessary truths should be given probability 1. We want to keep our language as simple as possible, so we do not have a notion of necessity represented in it. Therefore we cannot directly express this principle. But the Necessitation Rule for subjective probability 1, i.e.,\nappears to be a passable approxiomation to (and indeed weakening of) it.4 Since not only the purely mathematical principles about the rational numbers or the real numbers, but presumably also the normative principles that govern subjective rational probability are necessary, this rule should hold for all \u03d5, including those that include occurrences of Pr. Thus we have half of what is needed to generate a contradiction, i.e., we have reason to be worried. On the other hand, while Factivity seems eminently plausible for truth, it is not clearly a reasonable constraint on probability 1. The only principle concerning subjective probability, considered in the literature, that entails it, is the Principle of Regularity, which says that only necessary truths should be given subjective probability 1. The principle of Regularity is widely rejected as a constraint on rational subjective probability.5 Indeed there is prima facie reason to be suspicious about this principle: for instance, it seems natural to assign probability 1 to propositions that express elementary observational results, which are obviously contingent. In any case, we now already see that the situation is dire for calculi of typefree subjective probability that do include Regularity (such as certain non-Archimedean theories of probability)6, for then, if we accept Necessitation, the Kaplan-Montague argument goes through. In the light of these considerations, we reject Factivity and endorse Necessitation. We then cannot fully carry out the Kaplan-Montague argu-\nment for probability 1, and can at least hope to avoid contradiction. By rejecting Factivity, we position ourselves in an FS-like, rather than in a KFlike environment. Not only is Factivity to be rejected, but there seems also no reason to trust its weaker cousin Converse Necessitation. Even a proof that a given statement has probability 1 does not give us a compelling reason that that statement is true. When the truth predicate in FS is interpreted as a concept of probability rather than as truth, the resulting principles are close to a type-free version of the Kolmogorov axioms. Our strategy will therefore be to get as close as consistently possible to the Kolmogorov axioms in a typefree predicate setting, and against a reasonable mathematical background.\n# 3 Finite and \u03c3-additive typefree probability\nIn this section, we present an elementary formal theory of finite typefree subjective probability, and an elementary formal theory of \u03c3-additive typefree subjective probability. Moreover, we discuss some elementary properties of these two systems.\n# 3.1 Languages and background theories\nWe will define a basic theory of typefree finitely additive probability and a basic theory of \u03c3-additive probability. For finitely additive probability we do not need to take limits, so a background theory of the rational numbers suffices. For \u03c3-additive probability we do need to take limits, so a background theory of the real numbers is needed. The natural numbers in each case form a significant sub-collection of the domain of discourse. So we assume that each of the two languages contains a predicate N that expresses being a natural number.\n# 3.1.1 Q and LQ\nLet Q\u2212be some standard classical theory of the rational numbers, formulated in the language LQ\u2212, such that it contains the Peano Axioms restricted to N. The language LQ is defined as LQ\u2212\u222a{Pr}, where Pr is a two-place predicate such that Pr(x, y) expresses that the rational subjective probability of x is y. We will sometimes write Pr(x) = y instead. We assume that, in the finitely additive probability theory that we will define, the logical and nonlogical schemes of Q\u2212are extended to the language including Pr. This gives rise to the theory Q.\nLet R\u2212be some standard classical theory of the real numbers, formulated in a language LR\u2212, and let LR be defined as LR\u2212\u222a{Pr}. Again we assume that, in the probability theories that we will define, the logical and nonlogical schemes of R\u2212are are extended to the language including Pr. This gives rise to the theory R.\n# 3.1.3 Coding\nFor the language LQ, coding works in the usual way. But there are uncountably many real numbers. To deal with this, we proceed roughly as in [10]. Within R\u2212we can describe the language L\u221e R , which contains LR, but also contains constant symbols cx for each element x \u2208R. This formalisation of L\u221e R in LR provides us with a coding of the expressions of L\u221e R . For an L\u221e R -expression e we denote its code by \u231ce\u231d. We specially denote the code of cx for x \u2208R by \u02d9x. This formalisation also comes with a coding of various syntactic relations and operations on x \u2208R.7 As mentioned in the introduction, throughout the article we will often be sloppy in our notation.\n# 3.2 Finitely additive typefree probability\nWe first turn to the principles of the basic theory of finitely additive typefree probability, which we call RKf (\u201cReflexive Kolmogorov Finite\u201d). They are expressed in LQ, which is LQ\u2212\u222a{Pr}. Let Tmc be the set of constant terms and let t\u25e6be the value of term t (both notions can be expressed in LQ). The axioms are as follows:\nKf7\u2212Pr( \u02d9\u00acx) = 1 \u2212Pr(x) Kf8\u2212\nIn these axioms, the free variables are assumed to be universally quantified over. Kf4 is an axiom schema; concrete axioms are obtained from Kf4 by substituting formulas of LQ\u2212for the schematic letter \u03d5. A comparison with [16] shows that all principles of RKf except Kf4, Kf5, and Kf8 are Kolmogorov axioms. But Kf4 and Kf8 together aim to approximate the remaining Kolmogorov axiom, viz. the axiom that says that necessary truths have probability 1. In particular, rule Kf8 is justified because a proof of a statement \u03c6 from the (necessary) pure principles of typefree subjective probability entails that that \u03c6 is necessary, and therefore should get probability 1. In Leitgeb\u2019s systems of typefree probability, a slightly different necessity principle is adopted, namely\nwhere S is the background system without the principles of subjective probability [18, section 3]. This necessitation principle is of course sound, but it is obviously weaker than Kf8 in specific ways. Typefree systems can never be fully compositional, since type-freeness precludes an ordinary notion of rank of formulas. Nonetheless, FS has been touted as a highly compositional axiomatic theory of truth.8 The system RKf is also highly compositional, but slightly less so than FS, for the axiom Kf6 does not explain the truth conditions of probabilities of disjunctions in terms of truth conditions of formulae of lower rank. Axiom Kf5 has been included in order to compensate (to some degree) for this deficiency. As mentioned in the introduction, LQ can be extended by empirical vocabulary. Empirical truths can unproblematically be added to RKf as extra premises. But we do not automatically want to assign all empirical truths probability 1. So we do not simply want to add empirical truths as new axioms, for then they would fall in the scope of Kf8. RKf is at least minimally capable:\nQuestion 1 What is the propositional modal logic of probability 1, conceived as a modality?\n# Proposition 2 There is no consistent system S \u2283RKf for which S \u22a2\u2200x : BewS(x) \u2192Pr(x) = 1.\nProof. Assume S \u22a2\u2200x : BewS(x) \u2192Pr(x) = 1 and S is consistent. Take, by diagonalisation, a formula \u03d5 such that\nS \u22a2\u03d5 \u2194\u00ac(BewS(\u03d5) \u2192Pr(\u03d5) = 1)\nWe reason in S, and suppose \u03d5. Then \u00ac(BewS(\u03d5) \u2192Pr(\u03d5) = 1), which contradicts our assumption. So we have S \u22a2\u00ac\u03d5. By Kf8, then S \u22a2Pr(\u00ac\u03d5) = 1, i.e., S \u22a2Pr(\u03d5) = 0. So S \u22a2\u00acBewS(\u03d5), by our assumption. So by the second incompleteness theorem, S is inconsistent.\nObserve that our proof of the first part of this proposition shows that also the \u201clocal\u201d version of the principle \u2200x : BewS(x) \u2192Pr(x) = 1, i.e., the scheme BewS(\u03d5) \u2192Pr(\u03d5) = 1, is inconsistent. For reasonable S, the principle \u2200x : BewS(x) \u2192Pr(x) = 1 should be true, so we should be able consistently add it to S. Moreover, this principle looks similar to the uniform reflection principle for S. Indeed, we suggest that principles such as these are regarded as a kind of proof theoretic reflection principles. All this suggests the following question, which, as far as we know, is open: Question 2 Let conditional probability be defined in the usual way by the ratio formula. Is there a consistent system S \u2283RKf for which S \u22a2\u2200x : Pr(Bew(x) \u0338= 0) \u2192Pr(x | Bew(x)) = 1?\nHere the antecedent is of course inserted only so as to ensure that the consequent is well-defined.\nLet us now to turn to the question which principles we can consistently add to RKf. It is easy to see that adding probability iteration principles to RKf quickly leads to inconsistency.9 This means that despite its minimality, the principles of RKf already highly constrain the class of possible extensions. As a simple example, just to see how these arguments go, consider the probabilistic analogue of the S4 principle of modal logic, which we call Pr4 :10\n# Pr(\u03c6, 1) \u2192Pr(Pr(\u03c6, 1), 1).\nProposition 3 RKf + Pr4 is inconsistent. Proof. Take a probabilistic liar sentence \u03bb such that RKf \u22a2\u03bb \u2194\u00ac Pr(\u03bb, 1). (Such a \u03bb of course exists by the diagonal lemma.) Arguing in RKf, Necessitation of the left-to-right direction yields Pr(Pr(\u03bb, 1) \u2192\u00ac\u03bb, 1). Distributing Pr over the conditional gives us\nAn instance of Pr4 is Pr(\u03bb, 1) \u2192Pr(Pr(\u03bb, 1), 1). Putting these together gives us Pr(\u03bb, 1) \u2192Pr(\u00ac\u03bb, 1), i.e., \u00ac Pr(\u03bb, 1). Using the right-to-left direction of the instance of the diagonal lemma, we then have \u03bb, and by Necessitation Pr(\u03bb, 1), which contradicts our earlier result. Note that proposition 3 does not entail that there can be no models of RKf that make Pr(\u03c6, 1) \u2192Pr(Pr(\u03c6, 1), 1) true for all \u03d5 (or/and its converse). In our proof, we have applied rule Kf8 to a sentence obtained from Pr4. This is only permitted if Pr4 is taken as an extra axiom. In a similar way, it can be shown that a form of negative introspection, and also its converse, cannot consistently be added to RKf:\nAn instance of Pr4 is Pr(\u03bb, 1) \u2192Pr(Pr(\u03bb, 1), 1). Putting these together gives us Pr(\u03bb, 1) \u2192Pr(\u00ac\u03bb, 1), i.e., \u00ac Pr(\u03bb, 1). Using the right-to-left direction of the instance of the diagonal lemma, we then have \u03bb, and by Necessitation Pr(\u03bb, 1), which contradicts our earlier result.\n# Proposition 4\n1. The principle Pr(x) < 1 \u2192Pr(Pr(x) < 1) = 1 cannot consistently be added to RKf; 2. The principle Pr(Pr(x) < 1) = 1 \u2192Pr(x) < 1 cannot consistently be added to RKf.\nProof. The simple proofs of 1. and 2. are exactly like the proofs of Theorem 3e an Theorem 3g, respectively, in [21].\nFrom the point of view of typefree truth theory, the iteration principles that are the subject of propositions 3 and 4 are typical analogues of principles that belongs to the KF-family and are incompatible with FS. It is, as far as we can tell, an open and interesting question what reasonable analogues of KF for typefree subjective probability would look like. Propositions 2, 3, and 4 show that despite the fact that RKf is a basic system of typefree subjective probability, it is nonetheless fairly restrictive. In particular, it is not very tolerant of introspection principles. In this sense, our findings so far are in harmony with the anti-luminosity position that Williamson argues for on other grounds [26, chapter 4]. It is, however, consistent to add to RKf the converse of Pr4 , which we call CPr4, and which is called Transparency by Weisberg [25, p. 190]:11\nProposition 5 RKf + CPr4 is consistent.\n# Proposition 5 RKf + CPr4 is consistent.\nProof. This follows from the proof of Theorem 5 in [6], see also [5]. The point is that the theory RKf + CPr4 + \u201cfor every x, Pr(x) is either 1 or 0 or 1/2\u201d is interpretable in the theory of the model (Q, B\u03c9), with B\u03c9 characterized as in Definition 6 of [6] (cf. also Definition 13.4.5 of [5]). The interpretation is obtained by translating \u201cPr(x) = y\u201d as \u201c \ufffd y = 1 \u2227B(x) \ufffd\u2228 \ufffd y = 0 \u2227B(\u00acx) \ufffd\u2228 \ufffd y = 1/2 \u2227\u00acB(x) \u2227\u00acB(\u00acx) \ufffd \u201d. In particular, the truth of the interpretation of Cpr4 follows from the fact that the model (Q, B\u03c9) makes true the reflection axiom (A3) from Definition 4 of [6].\n# 3.3 \u03c3-additive typefree probability\nBasically, our theory of \u03c3-additive typefree probability, which we will call RK\u03c3 (\u201cReflexive Kolmogorov Sigma\u201d) is like RKf, except that an axiom of \u03c3-additivity is added. Its principles are:\nK\u03c35 Pr(x), Pr(y) \u2264Pr(x \u2228y) K\u03c36 Pr(x \u02d9\u2228y) = Pr(x) + Pr(y) \u2212Pr(x \u02d9\u2227y) K\u03c37\nK\u03c38 Pr( \u02d9\u2203x \u2208N : y( \u02d9x)) = lim n\u2192\u221ePr(y(0) \u2228. . . \u2228y(n))\nIn axiom K\u03c34, we use the fact that \u201cinternally\u201d we have names for all real numbers. This will play a role in some of the theorems in the next section. As before, K\u03c36 is a non-compositional axiom. Axiom K\u03c35 is introduced to compensate for this deficiency.\n# 4 Connection with the Friedman-Sheard system for typefree truth\nWe will relate RKf and RK\u03c3 to the Friedman-Sheard theory FS of typefree truth, which we assume the readers to be familiar with.12 But FS is formulated \u201cover\u201d N, whilst RKf is formulated \u201cover\u201d Q, and RK\u03c3 is formulated \u201cover\u201d R. So when we speak about FS from now on, we will assume it to be formulated \u201cover\u201d Q or \u201cover\u201d R: the context will make clear which is meant. We will not go into the boring but routine details of how to formulate FS \u201cover\u201d Q or \u201cover\u201d R.\nTheorem 1 RK\u03c3 is consistent, \u03c9-inconsistent, but sound for its mathematical sub-language. Proof. See [19].\nThe proofs of these properties are more or less \u201cborrowed\u201d from the metamathematics of FS. For instance, the proof of the \u03c9-inconsistency of RK\u03c3 is a straightforward adaptation of McGee\u2019s argument that shows that FS is \u03c9-inconsistent (see [12]). This should not surprise us. The system FS is known as \u201cthe most compositional typefree theory of truth\u201d. The systems RKf and RK\u03c3 are also to a high degree compositional, and include the Necessitation rule.13\nTheorem 1 shows that RK\u03c3 cannot serve as an acceptable background framework for formally investigating debatable principles concerning typefree subjective probability. Despite its mathematical soundness, its \u03c9inconsistency is, in our opinion, almost as bad as full inconsistency. The theory RKf can be trusted: all its theorems can be interpreted as true under the standard interpretation (see Corollary 2 below). Since, as we have seen in section 3.2, no simple introspection principles (with the exception of CPr4) can be consistently added as axioms to RKf, they do not form a part of the minimal theory of subjective probability. On the other hand, the theory RK\u03c3 is not to be be trusted, as it cannot be interpreted as true under the standard interpretation. In this context, we remind the reader that there is a long history of scepticism towards \u03c3-additivity as a principle governing subjective probability [7], [14].14 The connection between RK\u03c3 and FS goes even further than what theorem 1 describes:\n# Theorem 2 FS is relatively interpretable in RK\u03c3. Proof. (Sketch.) Let an intermediary system RKf\u03c3+ be defined as RKf\u03c3 +\nTheorem 2 FS is relatively interpretable in RK\u03c3. Proof. (Sketch.) Let an intermediary system RKf\u03c3+ be defined as RKf\u03c3 +\n\u2200x, y : Pr(x, y) \u2192(y = 0 \u2228y = 1).\nConsider the translation \u00b5 which is the homophonic translation for atomic mathematical formulae, commutes with the logical operators but restricts the quantifiers to the natural numbers, and has the following recursive clause for the truth predicate T:\n\u00b5(Tx) \u2261Pr(\u00b5(x), 1).\nThen \u00b5 is an interpretation of FS in RKf\u03c3+.15 In particular, for interpreting the right to left implication in the FS axiom \u2018\u2200\u03d5, \u03c8 \ufffd T(\u03d5 \u2228\u03c8) \u2261T(\u03d5) \u2228T(\u03c8) \ufffd \u2019 axiom K\u03c35 is used. But RKf\u03c3+ can be interpreted in RKf\u03c3 as follows. Let \u03b8 be the translation which is the homophonic translation for atomic mathematical formulae, commutes with the logical operators, and has the following recursive clause for Pr:\n\u03b8(Pr(x, y)) \u2261Pr(\u03b8(x), y) \u2227(y = 0 \u2228y = 1).\nThen \u03b8 interprets RKf\u03c3+ into RKf\u03c3. Stringing these two facts together gives us an interpretation of FS in RKf\u03c3.\nCorollary 1 RK\u03c3 is at least as strong as the first-order part of Ramified Analysis up to level \u03c9. Proof. This follows directly from theorem 2 and the fact that the arithmetical strength of FS is exactly the first-order fragment of Ramified Analysis up to level \u03c9 [12, section 5].\nSo if RK\u03c3 is to be believed\u2014but it isn\u2019t!\u2014then just like the notion of set, and the notion of truth, the notion of (typefree) subjective probability has (some) mathematical power. On the other hand, the notion of probability captured by RKf does not have mathematical power.\nIn addition, RTn+1 has the following necessitation rules for every i \u2264n and fo every \u03d5 \u2208Li:\nLemma 1 For every n, RTn is conservative over its background mathematical theory.\nLemma 1 For every n, RTn is conservative over its background mathematical\n(*) \u2200k, n\u2200M \ufffd M |= RTn \u2192\u2203S(M, S) |= RTn+1 \u21bek \ufffd .\nProof. The proof is basically a repetition of the argument for Theorem 14.31 in [13, p. 181\u2013185] with only minor changes: we use the functions gn defined on p. 181 in [13] to provide an interpretation of fragments of FS without the quantifier axioms (fragments with restricted number of application of Necessitation) in the RTn\u2019s.\nTheorem 3 RKf is proof-theoretically conservative (for the mathematical base language) over its background mathematical theory Q.\nProof. (Sketch.) Let again RKf+ be defined as RKf + \u2200x, y : Pr(x, y) \u2192(y = 0 \u2228y = 1), and let FS\u2212(over Q) be just like in definition 1. Now consider the translation \u03c4 which is the homophonic translation for atomic mathematical formulae, commutes with the logical operators, and has the following recursive clause for Pr:\nThen \u03c4 is an interpretation of RKf+ in FS\u2212. By lemma 2, FS\u2212is conservative over Q. Stringing these facts together gives us the conservativity result for RKf.\nLemma 3 FS\u2212can be interpreted in the standard model of arithmetic, hence it is \u03c9-consistent.\nProof. The interpretation of FS\u2212in the standard model of arithmetic is obtained by revision semantics. Let N be the standard model of arithmetic. Define T0 as empty, Tk+1 = {\u03c8 : (N, Tk) |= \u03c8}. Let T\u03c9 be the set of stable sentences, that is:\nDefine T as a maximal consistent extension of T\u03c9. Then (N, T) |= FS\u2212. Namely, given a proof (\u03d50 . . . \u03d5k) in FS\u2212, it can be demonstrated by induction that \u2200i \u2264k(\u03d5i \u2208T\u03c9 \u2227(N, T) |= \u03d5i). In particular, in the step for the necessitation rule, we use the fact that T\u03c9 is closed under necessitation.\nCorollary 2 RKf can be interpreted in the standard model of arithmetic, hence it is \u03c9-consistent.\nTheorem 2 and Corollary 2 provide support for the hypothesis that RKf is an acceptable background framework for formally investigating debatable principles concerning typefree subjective probability, whilst RK\u03c3 most definitely is not. RKf is a minimal system for reflexive subjective probability, whilst RK\u03c3 is a maximal system for reflexive subjective probability. Both systems represent natural positions in the landscape of systems of reflexive subjective probability.\n# 5 Probabilistic reflection\nSince RKf is an acceptable basic theory of typefree subjective probability, it is a suitable formal background against which questions of formal epistemology might be investigated. Let us have look at one example of this. In [23], van Fraassen proposed and explored the following probabilistic reflection principle:\nDefinition 3 (V, \u201cvan Fraassen\u201d)\n# Definition 3 (V, \u201cvan Fraassen\u201d)\n[n > 0 \u2227Prt(Prt+n(\u03d5) = a) \u0338= 0] \u2192 Prt(\u03d5 | Prt+n(\u03d5) = a) = a.\nHere the subscripts of Pr are real numbers, representing moments in time. Then V imposes a connection between future and current credences. The antecedent is of course needed to ensure that the conditional probability in the consequent is well-defined. The principle V (and variations on it) has been much discussed in the literature, and enjoys considerable popularity. Principle V has an air of ill-foundedness. If we think of later credences as determined, perhaps by conditionalisation, by earlier credences, in a way similar to the way in which higher level typed truth predicates are determined by lower level typed truth predicates, then V seems to break type restrictions. The variant of van Fraassen\u2019s V by setting n = 0 in V, is truly type-free; and as a coordination principle for probability functions through time, it seems interesting [4, p. 322]:\nDefinition 4 (RV)\nPr(Pr(\u03d5) = a) \u0338= 0 \u2192Pr(\u03d5 | Pr(\u03d5) = a) = a.\nProposition 6 RKf + RV is inconsistent. Proof. We reason in RKf + RV. By the diagonal lemma, we may take a sentence \u03bb such that \u22a2\u03bb \u2194Pr(\u03bb) < 1, or, equivalently, \u22a2\u00ac\u03bb \u2194Pr(\u03bb) = 1. Assume, for a reductio, that Pr(Pr(\u03bb) = 1) \u0338= 0. Then, by RV for the case where a = 1, Pr(\u03bb | Pr(\u03bb) = 1) = 1, which is equivalent to Pr(Pr(\u03bb) < 1 | Pr(\u03bb) = 1) = 1, which is in turn equivalent to\nwhich yields a contradiction. So we conclude \u22a2Pr(Pr(\u03bb) = 1) = 0. Then, by the diagonal property, \u22a2Pr(\u00ac\u03bb) = 0, which by a Kolmogorov axiom is equivalent to \u22a2Pr(\u03bb) = 1. By Necessitation, we then get \u22a2Pr(Pr(\u03bb) = 1) = 1, which gives us a contradiction.\n# \nThis again illustrates the restrictiveness of even the minimal calculus RKf. Other variants of van Fraassen\u2019s principle V have been considered in the literature. In the light of proposition 6, they should be regarded with suspicion. Indeed, Campbell-Moore considers the following variant V\u2217:\nShe shows by a simple diagonal argument: Proposition 7 RK f + V\u2217is inconsistent. Proof. Theorem 1.7.1 in [2].\nObserve that proposition 6 also tells against van Fraassen\u2019s principle V. An agent may not update her probability function during some interval [t, t + n], for some n > 0, because no new evidence has come in to conditionalize on, and because she has in this interval no reasons for adopting a radically different probability function. Then Prt = Prt+n. But if Prt satisfies RKf, then the pair Prt, Prt+n cannot satisfy RKf + V. Van Fraassen\u2019s principle V has been criticised anyway. Some drug might make one confident that one can fly; if I think I\u2019ll take this drug tomorrow, my present conditional confidence that I\u2019ll be able to fly tomorrow, given that tomorrow I\u2019ll be quite sure that I can fly, should not be very high [4, p. 321]. But RV has been taken by many as a law of rational subjective probability. Van Fraassen, for instance, refers to RV as\nthe \u201csynchronic\u2014I should think, uncontroversial\u2014 part of [V]\u201d [24, p. 19]. The point of proposition 6 is that the inconsistency of RV can be proved from Kolmogorov principles for finitely additive probability in a typefree setting.\n# References\n",
