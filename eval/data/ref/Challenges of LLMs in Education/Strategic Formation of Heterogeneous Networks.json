Meirom, Shie Mannor, Ariel Orda Dept. of Electrical Engineering\nTechnion - Israel Institute of Technology\nWe establish a network formation game for the Internet\u2019s Autonomous System (AS) interconnection topology. The game includes different types of players, accounting for the heterogeneity of ASs in the Internet. In this network formation game, the utility of a player depends on the network structure, e.g., the distances between nodes and the cost of links. We also consider the case where utility (or monetary) transfers are allowed between the players. We incorporate reliability considerations in the player\u2019s utility function, and analyze static properties of the game as well as its dynamic evolution. We provide dynamic analysis of topological quantities, and explain the prevalence of some \u201cnetwork motifs\u201d in the Internet graph. We assess our predictions with real-world data.\nThe structure of communication networks, in particular that of the Internet, has carried much interest. The Internet is a living example of a large, self organized, many-body complex system. Understanding the processes that shape its topology would provide tools for engineering its future. The Internet is assembled out of multiple Autonomous Systems (ASs), which are contracted by different economic agreements. These, in turn, compose the routing pathways among the ASs. With some simplifications, we can represent the resulting network as a graph, where two nodes (ASs) are connected by a link if traffic is allowed to traverse through them. The statistical properties of this \u201cInternet graph\u201d, such as the clustering properties, degree distribution etc., have been thoroughly investigated ([1], [2], [3]) However, without proper understanding of the mechanism that led to this structure, the statistical analysis alone lacks the ability to either predict the future evolution of the Internet nor to shape its evolution. A large class of models, a primary example is the \u201cpreferential attachment\u201d model [4], use probabilistic rules in order to simulate the network evolution and recover some of its\nstatistical properties, e.g., its degree distribution. Yet, these models fail to account for many other features of the network [5]. Possibly, one of the main reasons for that is they treat the ASs as passive elements rather than economic, profit-maximizing entities. An agent-based approach is a promising alternative. Game theory describes the behavior of interacting rational agents and the resulting equilibria, and it is one of the main tools of the trade in estimating the performance of distributed algorithms [6]. Game theory has been applied extensively to fundamental control tasks in communication networks, such as flow control [7], network security [8], routing [9], and wireless network design [10]. Recently, there has been increased activity in the field of network formation games. These studies aim to understand the network structure that results from interactions between rational agents ([11], [12]). Different authors emphasized different contexts, such as wireless networks [13] or the inter-AS topology ([14], [15]). The theme of such research is to investigate the equilibria\u2019s properties, e.g., establishing their existence and obtaining bounds on the \u201cprice of anarchy\u201d and \u201dprice of stability\u201d. These metrics measure from above and below, correspondingly, the social cost deterioration at an equilibrium compared with a (socially) optimal solution. Alternatively, agent-based simulations are used in order to obtain statistical characteristics of the resulting topology [16]. Nonetheless, the vast majority of these studies assume that the players are identical, whereas the Internet is a heterogeneous mixture of various entities, such as CDNs, minor ISPs, tier-1 ASs etc. There are only a few studies that have explicitly considered the effects of heterogeneity on the network structure. Some examples include [15], which extends a previous model of formation games for directed networks [11], and in the context of social networks, [17]. Most of the studies on the application of game theory to networks, with very few exceptions, e.g., [18], focused on static properties of the game. This is particularly true for network formation games. However, it is not clear that the Internet has reached an equilibrium. Indeed, ASs continuously draw new contracts, some merge with others while other quit business. In fact, a dynamic inspection of the inter-AS network suggests that the system may be far from equilibrium. Therefore, a dynamic study of an inter-AS network formation game is needed. In addition, previous work ignores an important requirement that Autonomous Systems has -\nreliability. Indeed, failures occur, and an AS must face such events. While some game theoretic works addressed reliability in other contexts ([19], [20]), to the best of our knowledge, there are no works that considered the topological properties that emerge in a heterogeneous, dynamic, network formation game with reliability constraints. We establish an analytically-tractable model, which explicitly accounts for the heterogeneity of players as well as reliability requirements. We base our model on the heralded Fabrikant model ([21], [22]). We model the inter-AS connectivity as a network formation game with heterogeneous players that may share costs by monetary transfers. We account for the inherent bilateral nature of the agreements between players, by noting that the establishment of a link requires the agreement of both nodes at its ends, while removing a link can be done unilaterally. As reliability comes into play, agents may require to be connected to other agents, or to all the other agents in the network, by at least two disjoint paths. We investigate both the static properties of the resulting game as well as its dynamic evolution. Game theoretic analysis is dominantly employed as a \u201ctoy model\u201d for contemplating about real-world phenomena. It is rarely confronted with real-world data. In this study we go a step further from traditional formal analysis, and we do consider real inter-AS topology data analysis to support our theoretical findings. The main contributions of this paper, which summarizes the findings in ([23], [24]), are as follows: \u2022 We evaluate static properties of the considered game, such as the prices of anarchy and stability and characterize additional properties of the equilibrium topologies. We introduce the concept of \"price of reliability\", which is defined as the ratio of the social cost with reliability constraints to the social cost with no such additional constraints. Surprisingly, we show that this price can be smaller than one, namely, that the additional reliability requirements may increase the social utility. \u2022 We discuss the dynamic evolution of the inter-AS network, and calculate convergence rates and basins of attractions for the different final states. Our findings provide useful insight towards incentive design schemes for achieving optimal configurations. Our model predicts the possible evolvement of some early emerging minor players (say, regional ISPs) to a major player, e.g., a tier-1 or tier-2 ASs, and the existence of a settlement-free clique, and\nthat most of the other contracts between players include monetary transfers. \u2022 We provide dynamical analysis of topological quantities, and explain the prevalence of some \u201cnetwork motifs\u201d, i.e., sub-graphs that appear frequently in the network. Through real-world data, we provide encouraging support to our predictions. In the next section, we describe our model. We discuss multiple variants, corresponding to whether utility transfers (e.g., monetary transfers) are allowed or not, and whether reliability constraints are in effect. In Section 3, we provide static analysis. Dynamic analysis is presented in Section 4. In section 5 we compare our theoretical predictions with real-world data on inter-AS topologies. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 6.\n# II. MODEL\nWe assume that each AS is a player. While there are many types of players, we aggregate them into two types: major league (or type-A) players, such as major ISPs, central search engines and the likes, and minor league (or type-B) players, such as local ISP or small enterprises. Each player, regardless of its type, may form contracts with other players, and should they reach a mutual understanding, a link between them is formed. A player\u2019s strategy is set by specifying which links it is interested in establishing, and, if permissible, the price it will be willing to pay for each. We denote the set of type-A (type B) player by TA (TB). A link connecting node i to node j is denoted as either (i, j) or ij. The total number of players is N = |TA| + |TB|, and we assume N \u22653. The shortest distance between nodes i and j is the minimal number of hops along a path connecting them and is denoted by d(i, j). Finally, the degree of node i is denoted by deg(i) and the connected component of i, given the set of links E, is \u0393(i). .\n# A. Basic model\nOur cost function is based on the cost structure in [21] and [22]. Players are penalized for their distance from other players. First and foremost, players require a good, fast connection to the major players, while they may relax their connection requirements to minor players. Bandwidth usage and delay depends heavily on the hop distance, and connection quality is represented by this metric. We weight the relative importance of a major player by a factor A > 1 in the cost function in the corresponding distance term. The link prices represent factors such as the link\u2019s\nmaintenance costs, bandwidth allocation costs etc. Different player types may incur different link costs, cA, cB, due to varying financial resources or infrastructure. Formally, the (dis-)utility of players is represented as follows. Definition 1. (basic mode) The cost function, C(bare) \u03b2 (i), of node i of type \u03b2 \u2208{A, B}, is defined as:\nC(bare) \u03b2 (i) \u225c deg(i) \u00b7 c\u03b2 + A \ufffd j\u2208TA d(i, j) + \ufffd j\u2208TB d(i, j)\nwhere A > 1 represents the relative importance of class A nodes over class B nodes. Then, the social cost is defined as S = \ufffd i C(i). Set c \u225c(cA + cB) /2. We assume cA \u2264cB. The optimal (minimal) social cost is denoted as S(bare) optimal (for brevity, Soptimal). We denote the the social cost at the optimal stable solution as \u02dcSoptimal. The price of stability is the ratio between the social cost at the best stable solution and its value at the optimal solution, namely PoS = \u02dcSoptimal/Soptimal. Similarly, denote by \u02dcSpessimal the highest social cost in an equilibrium. Then, the price of anarchy is the ratio between the social cost at the worst stable solution and its value at the optimal solution, namely PoA = \u02dcSpessimal/Soptimal. We denote the change in cost of player i as after the addition (removal) of a link (j, k) by \u2206C(i, E + jk) \u225cC (i, E \u222a(j, k)) \u2212C (i, E). The establishment of a link requires the bilateral agreement of the two parties at its ends, while removing a link can be done unilaterally. This is known as a pairwise-stable equilibrium [12], [18]. Definition 2. The players\u2019 strategies are pairwise-stable if for all i, j \u2208TA \u222aTB, the following hold: a) if ij \u2208E, then \u2206C(i, E \u2212ij) > 0; b) if ij /\u2208E, then either \u2206C(i, E + ij) > 0 or \u2206C(j, E + ij) > 0. The resulting graph is referred to as a stabilizable graph.\na) if ij \u2208E, then \u2206C(i, E \u2212ij) > 0; b) if ij /\u2208E, then either \u2206C(i, E + ij) > 0 or \u2206C(j, E + ij) > 0. The resulting graph is referred to as a stabilizable graph.\nIn many cases, ASs must maintain access to the Internet in case of a single link failure. This is tantamount to the requirement that all the players must have at least two link disjoint paths to each other node. If survivability constraints are in effect, we generalize the basic model by modifying the distance term in the cost function, and adding a term representing the distance\nalong the backup path. Nevertheless, if either link prices are high, crash frequencies are low or the content of a minor AS is of little value, players may relax their reliability requirements and demand the establishment of disjoint paths only to the major players. This is represented by a binary parameter \u03c4, which is set to one if two disjoint paths are required to all nodes, and zero if the reliability requirement holds for major players only. The relative weight of the primary path and the backup path is set by the parameter \u03b4. If failures are often, then the regular and backup paths (in the corresponding pair of link-disjoint paths) are used almost as frequently. As such, they must be weighted the same in the cost function. In this case, the likelihood of using either route is the same, and \u03b4 = 1. Conversely, if failures are rare, traffic will be mostly carried across the shorter path. Therefore, its length should carry more weight in the cost than the length of the backup route, hence \u03b4 \u226a1. Definition 3. (cost function under survivability constraints) The cost function, C(reliable) \u03b2 (i), of node i\nC(reliable) \u03b2 (i) \u225c deg(i) \u00b7 c\u03b2 + A 1 + \u03b4 \ufffd j\u2208TA (d(i, j) + \u03b4d\u2032(i, j))\n\ufffd +\u03c4 \u00b7 1 1 + \u03b4 \ufffd j\u2208TB (d(i, j) + \u03b4d\u2032(i, j)) + (1 \u2212\u03c4) \ufffd j\u2208TB d(i, j)\nwhere d(i, j) and d\u2032(i, j) are the lengths of a pair of paths between i, j that minimizes the cost function. d(i, j) denotes the length of the shorter path. Formally, denote a pair of disjoint paths connecting player i and player j as \ufffd R(i,j), R\u2032 (i,j) \ufffd \u03b1, where d\u03b1(i, j) (d\u2032 \u03b1(i, j)) is the length of shorter (correspondingly, longer) path. Set\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd We denote the change in cost of player i as after the addition (removal) of a link (j, k) by \u2206C(i, E+jk) \u225cC (i, E \u222a(j, k))\u2212C (i, E) (correspondingly, \u2206C(i, E\u2212jk) \u225cC (i, E \\ (j, k))\u2212 C (i, E)). The abbreviation \u2206C(i, jk) is often used. If \u03b4 = 1, then the two routing pathways are used the same. In this case, the shortest cycle length d(i, j)+d\u2032(i, j) is the relevant quantity that appears in the cost function. This can be found\nin polynomial time by Suurballe\u2019s algorithm ([25], [26]). However, if \u03b4 \u226a1, routing will occur along two disjoint paths, such that the length of the shortest between the two is shortest (among all pairs of disjoint paths). Although the complexity of finding this pair is NP-Hard, first finding the shortest path and then finding the next shortest path is a heuristic that works remarkably well, both in the real-world data analysis and on the networks obtained in the theoretical discussion. The reason behind this is that, when failures are rare, information is predominantly routed along the shortest path. When players are required to establish a fall-back route, they will establish a path that is disjoint from the current routing path, namely the shortest one. The additional reliability requirements result in additional link expenses, as for example, the degree of every node needs to be at least two. The price of reliability is the ratio between the optimal social cost under the additional survivability constraint to the optimal social cost when the additional constraints are removed. Definition 4. The price of reliability (PoR) is the ratio between the optimal value of the social costs among the set of corresponding stable equilibria, PoR = \u02dcSoptimal/ \u02dcS(bare) optimal. Surprisingly, we shall show that there exist scenarios in which reliability requirements increase the social utility, so that the price of reliability can be smaller than one. B. Utility transfer In the above formulation, we have implicitly assumed that players may not transfer utilities. However, often players are able to do so, in particular via monetary transfers. We incorporate such possibility by introducing an extended model, allowing for a monetary transaction in which player i pays player j some amount Pij iff the link (i.j) is established. Player j sets some minimal price wij and if Pij \u2265wij the link is formed. The corresponding change to the cost function is as follows. Definition 5. The cost function of player i when monetary transfers are allowed is \u02dcC(i) \u225c C(i) + \ufffd j,ij\u2208E (Pij \u2212Pji). In this definition the cost C(i) may be either C(reliable)(i) or C(bare)(i). Note that the social cost remains the same as in Def. 5 as monetary transfers are canceled by summation.\nin polynomial time by Suurballe\u2019s algorithm ([25], [26]). However, if \u03b4 \u226a1, routing will occur along two disjoint paths, such that the length of the shortest between the two is shortest (among all pairs of disjoint paths). Although the complexity of finding this pair is NP-Hard, first finding the shortest path and then finding the next shortest path is a heuristic that works remarkably well, both in the real-world data analysis and on the networks obtained in the theoretical discussion. The reason behind this is that, when failures are rare, information is predominantly routed along the shortest path. When players are required to establish a fall-back route, they will establish a path that is disjoint from the current routing path, namely the shortest one. The additional reliability requirements result in additional link expenses, as for example, the degree of every node needs to be at least two. The price of reliability is the ratio between the optimal social cost under the additional survivability constraint to the optimal social cost when the additional constraints are removed. Definition 4. The price of reliability (PoR) is the ratio between the optimal value of the social costs among the set of corresponding stable equilibria, PoR = \u02dcSoptimal/ \u02dcS(bare) optimal. Surprisingly, we shall show that there exist scenarios in which reliability requirements increase the social utility, so that the price of reliability can be smaller than one.\nMonetary transfers allow the sharing of costs. Without transfers, a link will be established only if both parties, i and j, reduce their costs, C(i, E + ij) < 0 and C(j, E + ij) < 0. Consider, for example, a configuration where \u2206C(i, E + ij) < 0 and \u2206C(j, E + ij) > 0. It may be beneficial for player i to offer a lump sum Pij to player j if the latter agrees to establish (i, j). This will be feasible only if the cost function of both players is reduced. It immediately follows that if \u2206C(i, E+ij)+\u2206C(i, E+ij) < 0 then there is a value Pij such that this condition is met. Hence, it is beneficial for both players to establish a link between them. In a game theoretic formalism, if the core of the two players game is non-empty, then they may pick a value out of this set as the transfer amount. Likewise, if the core is empty, or \u2206C(i, E + ij) + \u2206C(j, E + ij) > 0, then the best response of at least one of the players is to remove the link, and the other player has no incentive to offer a payment high enough to change the its decision. Formally: Corollary 6. When monetary transfers are allowed, the link (i, j) is established iff \u2206C(i, E + ij) + \u2206C(j, E + ij) < 0. The link is removed iff \u2206C(i, E \u2212ij) + \u2206C(j, E \u2212ij) > 0. In the remainder of the paper, whenever monetary transfers are feasible, we will state it explicitly, otherwise the basic model (without transfers or survivability constraints) is assumed. III. STATIC ANALYSIS In this section we discuss the properties of stable equilibria. Specifically, we first establish that, under certain conditions, the major players group together in a clique (section III-A). We shall further discuss topological properties that emerge from our analysis (section III-B). As a metric for the quality of the solution we apply the commonly used measure of the social cost, which is the sum of individual costs. We evaluate the price of anarchy, which is the ratio between the social cost at the worst stable solution and its value at the optimal solution, and the price of stability, which is the ratio between the social cost at the best stable solution and its value at the optimal solution (section III-C). We introduce utility transfers in section III-D, and consider the impact of survivability requirements on the prices of stability and anarchy in section III-E.\n# A. The type-A clique\nOur goal is understanding the resulting topology when we assume strategic players and myopic dynamics. Obviously, if the link\u2019s cost is extremely low, every player would establish links with\nall other players [21]. The resulting graph will be a clique. This is not a realistic setting. If two nodes are at a distance L+1 of each other, then there is a path with L nodes connecting them. By establishing a link with cost c, we are shortening the distance between the end node to \u223cL/2 nodes that lay on the other side of the line. The average reduction in distance is also \u2248L/2, so by comparing L2 \u22484c we obtain a bound on L, as follows: Lemma 7. The longest distance between any node i and node j \u2208TB is bounded by 2\u221acB. The longest distance between nodes i, j \u2208TA is bounded by \ufffd (1 \u22122A)2 + 4cA \u22122 (A \u22121). In addition, if cA < A then there is a link between every two type-A nodes. Proof: Assume d(i, j) = k \u22121 \u2265 \ufffd 2\u221acB \ufffd > 1 and i \u2208TB. Then there exist nodes (x1 = i, x2, ..xk = j) such that d(i, x\u03b1+1) = \u03b1. By adding a link (i, j) the change in cost of node i, \u2206C(i, E + ij) is, according to lemma 41 in the appendix,\nwhere d\u2032(i, x\u03b1) < d(i, x\u03b1) is the distance after the addition of the link (i, j) and \u03b4x\u03b1,A = 1 iff x\u03b1 \u2208TA. Therefore, it is of the interest of player i to add the link. Consider the case that j \u2208TA and\nd(i, j) = k \u22121 \u2265 \ufffd (1 \u22122A)2 + 4cB \u22122 (A \u22121) > 1\n(1)\nThe change in cost after the addition of the link (i, j) is\nTherefore it is beneficial for player i to establish the link. Similarly, if i \u2208TA then eq. 1 is replaced by k \u22121 \u2265 \ufffd (1 \u22122A)2 + 4cA \u22122 (A \u22121) > 1. In particular, if we do not omit the mod(k \u22121, 2) term and set k = 3 we get that if 2 \ufffd (\u22121 + A)A + cA \u22122(A \u22121) < 2 the distance between two type-A nodes is smaller than 2, in other words, they connected by a link. The latter expression can be recast to the simple form c < A. Recall that if the cost of both parties is reduced (the change of cost of node j is obtained by the change of summation to 0..k \u22121) a link connecting them will be formed. Therefore, if i, j \u2208TB then maximal distance between then is d(i, j) \u2264max{2\u221acB, 1} as otherwise it would be beneficial for both i, j to establish a link that will reduce their mutual distance to 1. Likewise, if i, j \u2208TA then\nd(i, j) \u2264 \ufffd (1 \u22122A)2 + 4cA \u22122 (A \u22121)\nusing an analogous reasoning. If i \u2208TA and j \u2208TB then it\u2019ll be worthy for player i to establish the link only if d(i, j) \u2265 \ufffd 2\u221acB \ufffd . In this case it\u2019ll be also worthy for player j to establish the\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f519/f519e0b9-2fb7-43c8-b94b-1a7505005ab5.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1.

This concludes our proof. Lemma 7 indicates that if 1 < cA < A then the type A nodes will form a clique (the \u201cnucleolus\u201d of the network). The type B nodes form structures that are connected to the type A clique (the network nucleolus). These structures are not necessarily trees and will not necessarily connect to a single point of the type-A clique only. This is indeed a very realistic scenario, found in many configurations. We shall compare this result to actual data on the inter-AS interconnection topology in section V. If c > A then the type-A clique is no longer stable. This setting does not correspond to the observed nature of the AS topology and we\u2019ll focus in all the following sections on the case 1 < cA < A.\n# B. Equilibria\u2019s properties\nHere we describe common properties of all pair-wise equilibria. We start by noting that, unlike the findings of several other studies [18], [27], [28], in our model, at equilibrium, the type-B nodes are not necessarily organized in trees. This is shown in the next example. Example 8. Assume for simplicity that cA = cB = c. Consider a line of length k of type B nodes, (1, 2, 3..., k) such that \u221a 8c > k + 1 > \u221a 2c or equivalently (k + 1)2 < 8c < 4 (k + 1)2. In addition, the links (j1, 1) and (j2, k) exist, where j1, j2 \u2208TA, i.e., the line is connected at\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0cbb/0cbb37a5-cf79-45f7-8685-28b9fe2798b2.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2.

In [29] we show that this is a stabilizable graph. Proof: We show that this structure is stabilizable. For simplicity, assume mod(k \u22121, 4) = 0 (k is odd and k\u22121 2 is odd). Any link removal (x1, x2) in the circle (j1, 1...k, j2, j1) will result in a line with nodes x1 and x2 at its ends (Fig. 2). We now show that if it beneficial for player i to remove the edge (i, i \u22121) for i \u2264 \ufffdk 2 \ufffd , then it is also true that it is beneficial for node i \u22121 to remove the edge (i\u22121, i\u22122). For player i, the removal of the edge (i, i\u22121) affects only the distance to the other players on the loop. This is also true for node i \u22121 and the removal of the edge (i \u22121, i \u22122). Denote the distances after the removal of the edge (i, i \u22121) by di (\u00b7, \u00b7). A simple geometrical observation shows that\nd (i, y) \u2212di (i, y) \u2265d (i \u22121, y) \u2212di\u22121 (i \u22121, y)\nfor every y = 1...k. In other words, the increase in the distance cost for node i after the removal of (i, i \u22121) is greater than the additional distance cost of player i \u22121 after the removal of the edge (i\u22121, i\u22122). Therefore, the type-B players that have the most incentive to disconnect a link are either node 1 or node k ( Fig. 2). Therefore, if players 1 or k would not deviate, no type-B player will deviate as well. W.l.o.g, we discuss node 1. Since cB < A, it is not beneficial for it to disconnect the link (j1, 1). Assume the link (1, 2) is removed. A simple geometric observation shows that the distance\nto nodes {2, .., k+3 2 } is affected, while the distance to all the other nodes remains intact (Fig. 2 The mean increase in distance is k+1 2 and the number of affected nodes is k+1 2 . However,\n# to nodes {2, .., k+3 2 } is affected, while the distance to all the other nodes remains intact (Fig. 2) The mean increase in distance is k+1 2 and the number of affected nodes is k+1 2 . However,\nand player 1 would prefer the link to remain. The same calculation shows that it is not beneficial for player j1 to disconnect (j1, 1). Clearly, if it not beneficial for j \u2208TA, j \u0338= j1, j2 to establish an additional link to a typeB player then it is not beneficial to do so for j1 or j2 as well. The optimal additional link connecting j and a type-B player is E = (j, k+1 2 ), that is, a link to the middle of the ring (Fig. 2). A similar geometric observation shows that by establishing this link, only the distances to nodes \ufffdk\u22121 4 , ..., 3k+1 4 \ufffd are affected (Fig. 2). The reduction in cost is\nand it is not beneficial to establish the link. In order to complete the proof, we need to show that no additional type-B to type-B links will be formed. By establishing such link, the distance of at least one of the parties to the typeA clique is unaffected. The previous calculation shows that by adding such link the maximal reduction of cost due to shortening the distance to type-B players is bounded from above by (k+1) 8 2. Therefore, as before, no additional type-B to type-B links will be formed. This completes the proof that this structure is stabilizable. Next, we bound from below the number of equilibria. For simplicity, we discuss the case where cA = cB = c. We accomplish that by considering the number of equilibria where the type-B players are organized in a forest (multiple trees) and the allowed forest topologies. The following lemma restricts the possible sets of trees in an equilibrium. Intuitively, this lemma states that we can not have two \u201cheavy\u201d trees, \u201cheavy\u201d meaning that there is a deep sub-tree with many nodes, as it would be beneficial to make a shortcut between the two sub-trees. Lemma 9. Assume cA = cB = c. Consider the BFS tree formed starting from node i. Assume that node j is k levels deep in this tree. Denote the sub-tree of node j in this tree by Ti(j) (Fig. 3) In a link stable equilibrium, the number of nodes in sub-trees satisfy either |Ti(j)| < c/k or\n# \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/a957/a957cf65-5bef-4987-809a-50a07b1a148e.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3.

Therefore, it is beneficial for player i to establish the link. Likewise, if |Tj(i)| < c/k then it would be beneficial for player j to establish the link and the link will be established. Hence, one of the conditions must be violated. The following lemma considers the structure of the type-B players\u2019 sub-graph. It builds on the results of lemma 9 to reinforce the restrictions on trees, showing that trees must be shallow and small. Lemma 10. Assume cA = cB = c. If the sub-graph of type-B nodes is a forest (Fig. 3), then there is at most one tree with depth greater than \ufffd c/2 and there is at most one tree with more than c/2 nodes. The maximal depth of a tree in the forest is \u221a 2c \u22121. Every type-B forest in which every tree has a maximal depth of min \ufffd\ufffd c/2, \u221ac \u22123 \ufffd and at most min {c/2, \u221ac} nodes is stabilizable. Proof: Assume there are two trees S1, S2 that have depth greater than \ufffd c/2 . The distance between the nodes at the lowest level is greater than 2 \ufffd c/2 + 1 as the trees are connected by at least one node in the type-A clique, d(i, j) \u22652 (Fig. 3). This contradicts with Lemma 7. Assume there are two trees S1, S2 with roots i, j that have more than c/2 nodes. In the BFS tree in which node i is the root, node j is at least in the second level (as they are connected by at least one node in the type-A clique). This contradicts with Lemma 9. Finally, following the footsteps of Lemma 9 proof, consider two trees Ti and Tj, with corresponding roots i and j (i.e., nodes i and j have a direct link with the type-A clique). Consider a link (x, y), where x \u2208Ti and y \u2208Tj. At least one of them does not reduce its distance to the type-A clique by establishing this link. W.l.o.g, we\u2019ll assume this is true for player x. Therefore,\nas the maximal reduction in distance is \u221ac and the maximal number of nodes in Tj is also \u221ac. Therefore, it is not beneficial for player x to establish this link, and the proof is completed. Finally, the next proposition provides a lower bound on the number of link-stable equilibria\nby a product of |TA| and a polynomial with a high degree (\u22482 \u221ac) in |TB|. Proposition 11. Assume cA = cB = c. The number of link-stable equilibria in which the subgraph of TB is a forest is at least \u03c9(|TA||TB|Nc), where Nc = o(2 \u221ac 2 /\u221ac) is a function of c only. Therefore, the number of link-stable equilibria is at least o(|TA||TB|Nc). Proof: We bound the number of link-stable equilibria from below by considering the number of link-stable graph, in which the minor players are organized in trees of up to depth \ufffd c/2 and exactly \u221ac nodes. The number of such trees can be bounded from below by the number of trees with \u221ac elements, depth \ufffd c/2 and only one non-leaf node at each level of tree, which is\n\uf8ed \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd \uf8f8 Therefore, the minor players can be organized in at least \uf8eb \uf8ed|TB| + Nc Nc \uf8f6 \uf8f8different configurations. Using Striling\u2019s approximation, we have \uf8eb \uf8ed|TB| + Nc Nc \uf8f6 \uf8f8\u2208\u03c9(|TB|Nc). Each tree can be connected to either one of the type-A nodes, and therefore the number of possible configurations is at least \u03c9(|TA||TB|Nc) . To sum up, while there are many equilibria, in all of them nodes cannot be too far apart, i.e., a small-world property. Furthermore, the trees formed are shallow and are not composed of many nodes.\nTherefore, the minor players can be organized in at least \uf8eb \uf8ed\nAs there are many possible link-stable equilibria, a discussion of the price of anarchy is in place. First, we explicitly find the optimal configuration. Although we establish a general expression for this configuration, it is worthy to also consider the limiting case of a large network, |TB| \u226b1, |TA| \u226b1. Moreover, typically, the number of major league players is much smaller than the other players, hence we also consider the limit |TB| \u226b|TA| \u226b1. Proposition 12. Consider the network where the type B nodes are connected to a specific node\n# \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/2d72/2d72b15a-8400-4aca-b02c-e93534c33d38.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4.

For every player j and i \u2208TB, any additional link (i, j) will result in \u2206C(j, E + ij) \u2265cB \u22121 > 0 since the link only reduces the distance d(i, j) from 2 to 1. Hence, player j has no incentive to accept this link and no additional links will be formed. This concludes the stability proof. We now turn to discuss the optimality of this network structure. First, consider a set of type-A players. Every link reduce the distance of at least two nodes by at least one, hence the social cost change by introducing a link is negative, since 2cA \u22122A < 0. Therefore, in any optimal configuration the type-A nodes form a complete graph. The other terms in the social cost are due to the inter-connectivity of type-B nodes and the type-A to type-B connections. As deg(i) = 1 for all i \u2208TB the cost due to link\u2019s prices is minimal. Furthermore, d(i, j) = 1 and the distance cost to node j (of type A) is minimal as well. For all other nodes j\u2032, d(i, j\u2032) = 2.\nAssume this configuration is not optimal. Then there is a topologically different configuration in which there exists an additional node j\u2032 \u2208TA for which d(i, j\u2032) = 1 for some i \u2208TB. Hence, there\u2019s an additional link (i, j). The social cost change is 2c+1+A . Therefore, if A+1 2 \u2264c this link reduces the social cost. On the other hand, if A+1 2 > c every link connecting a type-B player to a type-A player improves the social cost, although the previous discussion show these link are unstable. In this case, the optimal configuration is where all type-B nodes are connected to all the type-A players, but there are no links linking type-B players. This concludes the optimality proof. The cost due to inter-connectivity of type A nodes is\ncA|TA| (|TA| \u22121) + A|TA| (|TA| \u22121) = |TA| (|TA| \u22121) (cA + A) .\nThe first expression is due to the cost of |TA| clique\u2019s links and the second is due to distance (=1) between each type-A node. The distance of each type B nodes to all the other nodes is exactly 2, except to node j, to which its distance is 1. Therefore the social cost due to type B nodes is 2|TB|(|TB| \u22121) + 2cB|TB| + 2 (A + 1) |TB| ((|TA| \u22121) + (A + 1) + 2 (A + 1) (|TA| \u22121)) =2|TB| (|TB| \u22121 + cB + (A + 1) (|TA| \u22121/2)) .\nThe terms on the left hand side are due to (from left to right) the distance between nodes of type B, the cost of each type-B\u2019s single link, the cost of type-B nodes due to the distance (=2) to all member of the type-A clique bar j and the cost of type B nodes due to the distance (=1) to node j. The social cost is \ufffd C(i) = 2|TB| (|TB| \u22121 + c + (A + 1) (|TA| \u22121/2)) + |TA| (|TA| \u22121) (cA + A) . To complete the proof, note that if A+1 2 > c the latter term in the social cost of the optimal (and unstable) solution is 2|TB|(|TB|\u22121)+2c|TB| (1 + |TA|)+(A + 1) |TB||TA| = 2|TB| \ufffd |TB| \u22121 + \ufffdA + 1 2 + c \ufffd |TA| \ufffd . As the number of links is |TB| (1 + |TA|) and the distance of type-B to type-A nodes is 1.\nConsidering all quantities in the limit |TB| \u226b|TA| \u226b1 completes the proof. Next, we evaluate the price of anarchy. In order to do that, we use the following two lemmas. The first lemma evaluates a lower bound by considering the social cost in the stabilizable topology presented in Fig 1(b), composed of a type-A clique and long lines of type-B players. Later on, an upper bound is obtained by examining the social cost in any topology that satisfies Lemma 7. For simplicity, in the following lemma we assume that |TB| = min \ufffd\ufffd\u221a4cA \ufffd , \ufffd\ufffd 4cB/5 \ufffd\ufffd m where m \u2208N and cB \u226420cA. Lemma 13.

The total cost in this stabilizable network is S = |TA| (|TA| \u22121) (cA/2 + A) + 2cB|TB| + (A + 1) |TB| (|TA| \u22121) (k + 3) /2 +|TB| ((A + 1) (k + 1) /2 + 2k \u22124) + 2|TB|2(k + 2)2 \u22122m if |TB| \u226b1, |TA| \u226b1 then S = (A + 1) |T| |T| o(c)\nConsidering all quantities in the limit |TB| \u226b|TA| \u226b1 completes the proof. Next, we evaluate the price of anarchy. In order to do that, we use the following two lemmas.

Consider j\u2032 \u2208TA, j\u2032 \u0338= j. Let us observe the chain (j, 1, 2, 3, ...k) where 1, 2, 3...k \u2208TB. Clearly, the most beneficial link in j\u2032 concern is (j\u2032, k). By establishing it, its cost\u2019s change is\nby lemma 41 and noting the distance to player j is unaffected. Therefore there is no incentive for player j\u2032 to add the link (j\u2032, k). The same calculation indicates that no additional link (i, i\u2032)\nwill be formed between two nodes on the same line. Consider two lines of length k, (j, x1, x2, ...xk) and (j, y1, y2, ...yk). Consider the addition of the link (xk, y\u230ak+1/2\u230b). That is, the addition of a link from an end of one line to the middle player on another line. This link is optimal in x\u2032 ks concern, as it minimizes the sum of distances from it to players on the other line. The change in cost is (see appendix)\n\u2206C(xk, E + xky\u230ak+1/2\u230b) \u2264 \u2206C(xk, E + xkyi)\nsince the player that gains the most from establishing a link to a node on the another line is the player that is furthest the most from that line, i.e., the player at the end of the line. This concludes the stability proof. The total cost due to type-B nodes is\n2cB|TB| + (A + 1) |TB| (|TA| \u22121) (k + 3) /2\n2cB|TB| + (A + 1) |TB| (|TA| \u22121) (k + 3) /2 + |TB| (A + 1) (k + 1) /2 + 2m(k \u22121)2 + 2(m \u22121)mk2(k + 2)2.\nThe terms represent (from left to right) the links\u2019 cost, the cost due to the type-B players\u2019 distances to the type-A clique\u2019s nodes (except j), the cost due to the type-B players\u2019 distances from node j, the cost due to intra-line distances and the cost due inter-lines distances. By using the relation |TB| = km we have\n|TA| (|TA| \u22121) (cA + A) .\n\ufffd C(i) = |TA| (|TA| \u22121) (cA/2 + A) + 2cB|TB| + (A + 1) |TB| (|TA| \u22121) (k + 3) /2 +|TB| ((A + 1) (k + 1) /2 + 2k \u22124) + 2|TB|2(k + 2)2 \u22122m \u2192 |TA|2 (cA + A) + (A + 1) |TA| |TB| o(k) + |TB|2 o(k).\nThe most prevalent situation is when |TB| \u226b|TA| \u226b1. In this case we can bound the price of anarchy to be at least o(k2) = o(cB). The next lemma bounds the price of anarchy from above by bounding the maximal total cost in the a link-stable equilibrium.\nThe most prevalent situation is when |TB| \u226b|TA| \u226b1. In this case we can bound the price of anarchy to be at least o(k2) = o(cB). The next lemma bounds the price of anarchy from above by bounding the maximal total cost in the a link-stable equilibrium.\nProof: The total cost due to the inter-connectivity of the type-A clique is identical for all link stable equilibria and is |TA| (|TA| \u22121) (cA + A). The maximal distance between nodes i, j according to Lemma 7 is \ufffd 2\u221acB \ufffd and therefore the maximal cost due to the distances between type-B nodes is \ufffd 2\u221acB \ufffd |TB| (|TB| \u22121). Likewise, the maximal cost due to the distance between type-B nodes and the type-A clique is (A + 1) \u230a2\u221ac\u230b|TA||TB|. Finally, the maximal number of links between type-B nodes is |TB| (|TB| \u22121) /2 and the total cost due to this part is |TB| (|TB| \u22121) cB. Adding all the terms we obtain the required result. To summarize, we state the previous results in a proposition.\nD. Monetary transfers Monetary transfers allow for a redistribution of costs. It is well known in the game theoretic literature that, in general, this process increases the social welfare.Indeed, the next lemma, shows that in this setting, the maximal distance between players is smaller, compared to Lemma 7.\nMonetary transfers allow for a redistribution of costs.

This network is stabilizable iff utility transfer is allowed, as discussed in Prop. 12  Prop. 17.</div>\nthe additional links in the optimal state (shown in [?]) (Fig. 4), connecting a major league player with a minor league player, are unstable as the type-A players lack any incentive to form them. By allowing monetary transfers, the minor players can compensate the major players for the increase in their costs. It is worthwhile to do so only if the social optimum of the two-player game implies it. The existence or removal of an additional link does not inflict on any other player, as the distance between every two players is at most two. Proposition 17. The price of stability is 1. If A+1 2 \u2264c , then Proposition 12 holds. Furthermore, if A+1 2 > c, then the optimal stable state is such that all the type B nodes are connected to all nodes of the type-A clique. In the latter case, the social cost of this stabilizable network is S = 2|TB| \ufffd |TB| + \ufffdA+1 2 + c \ufffd |TA| \ufffd + |TA|2 (c + A) . Furthermore, if |TB| \u226b1, |TA| \u226b1 then, omitting linear terms in |TB|, |TA|, S = 2|TB|(|TB| + (A + c) |TA|) + |TA|2 (c + A) . Proof: For the case A+1 2 \u2264c , it was shown in Prop. 12 that the optimal network is a network where all the type B nodes are connected to a specific node j \u2208TA of the type-A clique (Fig. 4(a)) and that this network is stabilizable. Therefore, we only need to address its stability under monetary transfers. We apply the criteria described in Corollary 6 and show that for every two players i, j\u2032 such that (i, j\u2032) /\u2208E we have \u2206C(i, E + ij) + \u2206C(j\u2032, E + ij\u2032) > 0.\nIf i \u2208TB then\n\u2206C(i, E + ij\u2032) = cB \u22121 > 0.\n# Then, for i \u2208TB and either j\u2032 \u2208TA or j\u2032 \u2208TB we have \u2206C(i, E+ij)+\u2206C(j\u2032, E+ij\u2032) > 0 and the link would not be established. For every edge (i, j) \u2208E we have that both \u2206C(i, E+ij) < 0 and \u2206C(j, E + ij) < 0 (Prop. 12) and therefore\nThen, for i \u2208TB and either j\u2032 \u2208TA or j\u2032 \u2208TB we have \u2206C(i, E+ij)+\u2206C(j\u2032, E+ij\u2032) > 0 and the link would not be established. For every edge (i, j) \u2208E we have that both \u2206C(i, E+ij) < 0 and \u2206C(j, E + ij) < 0 (Prop. 12) and therefore\n\u2206C(i, E + ij) + \u2206C(j, E + ij) < 0.\nAssume A+1 2 > c. It was shown in Proposition 12 that the optimal network is a network where every type B player is connected to all the members of the type-A clique (Fig. 4(b)). Under monetary transfers, this network is stabilizable, since for for i \u2208TB , j \u2208TA\nAssume A+1 2 > c. It was shown in Proposition 12 that the optimal network is a network where every type B player is connected to all the members of the type-A clique (Fig. 4(b)). Under monetary transfers, this network is stabilizable, since for for i \u2208TB , j \u2208TA \u2206C(i, E + ij) + \u2206C(j\u2032, E + ij\u2032)\n= 2c \u2212A \u22121 < 0\nand the link (i, j) will be formed. The previous discussion shows that it is not beneficial to establish links between two type-B players. Therefore, this network is stabilizable. In conclusion, in both cases, the price of stability is 1. Next, we show that, under mild conditions on the number of type-A nodes, the price of anarchy is 3/2, i.e., a fixed number that does not depend on any parameter value. As the number of major players increases, the motivation to establish a direct connection to a clique member increases, since such a link reduces the distance to all clique members. As the incentive increases, players are willing to pay more for this link, thus increasing, in turn, the utility of the link in a major player\u2019s perspective. With enough major players, all the minor players will establish direct links. Therefore, any stable equilibrium will result in a very compact network with a diameter of at most three. This is the main idea behind the following lemma and theorem. Proof: Assume d(i, j) = k > 2, where i \u2208TB and j \u2208TA but node j is not the nearest type-A node to i. Therefore, there exists a series of nodes (x0 = i, x1, ..., xk\u22121, xk = j) such that xk\u22121 is a member of the type-A clique.\n# \n# The corresponding change in player i\u2019s cost is\nThe corresponding change in player i\u2019s cost is\n\u2206C(i, E + ij) < cB \u2212k2/4 \u2212(2k \u22124)A \u2212(k \u22122) A \u00b7 (|TA| \u22122) .\nThe first term is the link cost, the second and third terms are due to change of distance from players xk\u22121, xk and the last term express the change of distance form the rest of the type-A clique. As \u2206C(i, E + ij) < cB \u2212k2/4 \u2212(k \u22122) A \u00b7 |TA|\nthe total change in cost is\n\u2206C(j, E + ij) + \u2206C(i, E + ij) < 2c \u2212k2/2 \u2212(k \u22122) A \u00b7 |TA| < 0\n\u2206C(j, E + ij) + \u2206C(i, E + ij) < 2c \u2212k2/2 \u2212(k \u22122) A \u00b7 |TA|\nk < \ufffd (A|TA|)2 + 4cA|TA| \u2212A|TA|\nNote that as the number of member in the type-A clique, |TA|, increases, the right expression goes to 0, in contradiction to our initial assumption. Therefore, in the large network limit the maximal distance of a type-B node from a node in the type-A clique is 2. In this case, the maximal distance between two type-A nodes is 1 (as before), between type-A and type-B nodes\n# S = 3|TB|2 + 2|TB||TA| (A + 1) + |TA|2 (cA + A) .\n# comparing this with the optimal cost in this limit\ncomparing this with the optimal cost in this limit\nSopt = 2|TB|2 + 2|TB||TA| (A + 1) + |TA|2 (cA + A)\nwe obtain the required result. This theorem shows that by allowing monetary transfers, the maximal distance of a type-B player to the type-A clique depends inversely on the number of nodes in the clique and the number of players in general. The number of ASs increases in time, and we may assume the number of type-A players follows. Therefore, we expect a decrease of the mean \u201cnode-core distance\u201d in time. Our data analysis (Section V) indicates that this real-world distance indeed decreases in time.\n# E. The effect of survivability\nOne may have guessed that reliability requirements, which generally induce the creation of additional, backup edges, would ease the formation of the clique. The next proposition shows that this naive assumption is wrong, and in fact, as the frequency of failure increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the major player\u2019s clique. Consider a dense set, in which every player may access all the other players within two hops by a at least two disjoint paths. A direct link between two players only reduces their mutual distance by one, and does not affect any other distance. If this link fails often, it may be used only partially, and it may not be worthy to pay its cost. Hence, in this setting, counter intuitively, frequent failures end up with a sparser network. Proposition 18. Assume the frequency of failures is high, namely \u03b4 = 1. Then, the type-A players form a clique if and only if cA < A/2. Allowing monetary transfers does not change the result.\nProof: We consider a major player\u2019s clique and ask under which conditions the removal of a link is a worthy move. Consider an edge (i, j) in this clique. Since only the shortest distance between players i and j is affected, and is increased by one, the type-A players clique is stable if and only if A/ (1 + \u03b4) > cA. The next proposition describes a scenario in which, surprisingly, the additional reliability constraints reduce the social cost. Proposition 19. Assume 1 < cA < A/2 and symmetric reliability requirements, namely \u03c4 = 1. Then, the optimal network is composed of a type-A clique, where all the type B nodes are connected to all members of the type-A clique, as depicted in Fig. 4. This network is not stabilizable, and PoS > 1. Nevertheless, for |TB| \u226b|TA| \u226b1, we have PoS \u21921. In addition, the Price of Reliability is smaller than one. The main idea behind this result is that in the optimal, yet unstable solution, every minor player established a link with all the major players (Fig. 4). This configuration is unstable as it is over-saturated with links, and the optimal stable solution with survivability considerations is obtained by diluting this network so that every minor player will connect to just two major players. If the reliability requirements are further removed, then the additional dilution occurs, increasing the social cost. In other words, the stable configuration is under-saturated with edges, and the additional survivability requirements facilitate the formation of additional links. Proof: \u00ef\u00bf\u0153 \u00ef\u00bf\u0153 We shall now prove the first part of this theorem, namely that the network described in Fig. 4, is optimal in terms of social cost. In this network, every type-B player is connected to every type-A player. We denote this network by G. First, consider a network in which the type-A players are not in a clique. Similar to Proposition 18, there exists two players i, j \u2208TA such that d(i, j) \u22652. By establishing a link (i, j) the change in social cost is \ufffd \ufffd\nTherefore a network which includes this link has a lower social cost. Hence, in the optima network, all the type-A players are in clique. A similar calculation for a missing link between\nand establishing this link reduces the social cost as well. In conclusion, in an optimal network a type-A player is connected to all the other players. Consider node i \u2208TB. Its distance from every other node j \u2208TB is d(i, j) = 2 and d\u2032(i, j) = 2. The minimal distances between two minor players i, j \u2208TB are d(i, j) = 1 and d\u2032(i, j) = 2 whereas in G we have d(i, j) = d\u2032(i, j) = 2. Assume that a network with a lower social cost exists, and denote it by G\u2032. In G\u2032 there must exists a link between two type-B players, i, j \u2208TB. However, removing this link reduces the social cost, as\n# S(E + ij) \u2212S(E) = 2 \ufffd A 1 + \u03b4 \u2212c \ufffd > 0\nS(E + ij) \u2212S(E) = 2 \ufffd A 1 + \u03b4 \u2212c \ufffd > 0\nTherefore, G\u2032 is not optimal, in contradiction to our assumption. This proves that G is optimal. Next, we are going to show G is unstable. Consider i \u2208TB and x \u2208TA. By removing (i, x) we cost change of player x is\n\u2206C(x, E \u2212ix) = \u22122 \ufffd 1 1 + \u03b4 \u2212c \ufffd > 0\nAnd therefore it is beneficial for player x to remove this link. Hence, this network in not stabilizable. Finally, we are going to show that the PoR < 1. The outline is as follows. First, we are going to show that the network depicted in Fig. 4 is stable. The optimal stable network (without reliability requirements) in this parameter regime was explicitly derived Proposition 12. We are going to show that the cost in the latter network is higher than the former, which bound the PoR from above by a value smaller than one. Consider a network in which all the minor players are connected to two major players, x, y \u2208 TA. We are going to show that this network is stable. Clearly, as shown before, the type-A clique is stable. In addition, for any player i \u2208TB neither x, y nor i has the incentive to remove either (x, i) or (y, i) as it would violate the reliability requirement and would lead to unbounded cost. Hence, this network is stable. Denote this network by \u02dcG. In Proposition 12 it was shown that\nthe optimal stable network (without reliability requirements) in this configuration is the network in which all type-A players form a clique, and all the type-B players are connected to a single type-A player. We denote the latter network by G\u2032\u2032.We have\nBut,\nIn conclusion, if the failure frequency is high, the survivability requirements will induce dilution of the clique of major players. However, the opposite effect occurs along the graph cut-set between the minor players set and the major players set, where the additional constraints lead to an increased number of links connecting major and minor players. So far we have assumed that the reliability requirements are symmetric. As explained in the Introduction, in some cases it is reasonable to assume that players will require a backup route only to the major players, i.e., non-symmetric reliability constraints. We shall now show that in this case, the social cost may deteriorate considerably. Hence, from a system designer point of view, it is much more important to incentivize a configuration where the reliability requirements are symmetric, than to reduce failure frequency globally. This result stems from the following lemma. Lemma 20. If \u03c4 \u0338= 0 then for every two nodes i,j, d(i, j) \u2264d\u2032(i, j) \u22642 + 2cB. If \u03c4 = 0 there exists stable equiliberia such that there are no two disjoint paths between some nodes i, j. Proof: First, we are going to show that d\u2032(i, j) is finite (step 1). Then, in the second step, we shall bound d\u2032(i, j) from above. Step 1: If i and j are disconnected, then it is worthy for both of them to establish the link (i, j). Therefore, there exists a path from i to j and d(i, j) is finite. Assume d(i, j) \u0338= 1. If there aren\u2019t two disjoint paths between nodes i and j, it is worthy for both nodes to establish a direct link. Hence if d(i, j) \u0338= 1 the distance d\u2032(i, j) is finite. We now discuss the case d(i, j) = 1 and show there must exists an additional disjoint path, so d\u2032(i, j) is finite. We prove by negation. Take node x \u0338= i, j. As before, both d(i, x) and d(x, j) are finite. Consider the following two\nA) d(i, x) = 1, d(x, j) = 1. Then, the trajectory (i, x, j) is disjoint from the path. Hence d\u2032(i, j) is finite. B) d(i, x) = 1, d(x, j) \u0338= 1 or d(i, x) \u0338= 1, d(x, j) = 1. Without loss of generality, we assume the first case. According to the previous discussion, there are at least two disjoint paths from x to j. Since they are disjoint, only one of them may contain the edge (i, j). Therefore, there exist a path (i, x, ...j) that is disjoint from the edge (i, j) and therefore d\u2032(i, j) is finite. C) d(i, x) \u0338= 1, d(x, j) \u0338= 1 . Applying the same reasoning as in B), there exists a path from i to x that is disjoint from the edge (i, j). Likewise, there exists a path from j to x that is disjoint from the edge (i, j). Therefore there exist a path from i to j that is disjoint from (i, j). Step 2: Step 1 has shown that every two nodes are connected by a cycle. Let us assume the longest shortest cycle connecting two nodes is of length l > 2 + 2cB > 3, namely there exists a cycle (x0, x1, x2, ..., x\u230al/2\u230b, ...xl, x0). By establishing the link (x0, x\u230al/2\u230b) the cost of player x0 due to distances from other players is reduced by at least (l2 \u22121 + mod(l + 1, 2)) /4, hence the link will be established as \u2206C \ufffd x0, E + (x0, x\u230al/2\u230b \ufffd \u2264 \ufffd l2 \u22121 + mod(l + 1, 2) \ufffd \u2212cB \u22640 and similarly \u2206C \ufffd x0, E + (x0, x\u230al/2\u230b \ufffd \u22640 . Since d(i.j) \u2264d\u2032(i.j) \u2264l the proof is complete. If there exist players with no two disjoint paths in an equilibrium, then the social cost becomes unbounded. This immediately results in an unbounded Price of Anarchy, as indicated by the following theorem. Theorem 21. Consider a network such that TB \u226bTA \u226b1. The Price of Anarchy is as follows: A) In a setting with asymmetric reliability requirements (\u03c4 = 0): unbounded. B) In a setting with symmetric reliability requirements (\u03c4 \u0338= 0): bounded by o(c). Proof: A) We shall prove this by showing that there exists a stable equilibrium with unbounded social cost. Consider a network in which the major players (type-A players) form a clique, while every minor player is connected only to a single type-A player j \u2208TA. We shall show that this network is stabilizable. As discusses before, the type-A clique is stable. Consider\nA) d(i, x) = 1, d(x, j) = 1. Then, the trajectory (i, x, j) is disjoint from the path. Hence d\u2032(i, j) is finite. B) d(i, x) = 1, d(x, j) \u0338= 1 or d(i, x) \u0338= 1, d(x, j) = 1. Without loss of generality, we assume the first case. According to the previous discussion, there are at least two disjoint paths from x to j. Since they are disjoint, only one of them may contain the edge (i, j). Therefore, there exist a path (i, x, ...j) that is disjoint from the edge (i, j) and therefore d\u2032(i, j) is finite. C) d(i, x) \u0338= 1, d(x, j) \u0338= 1 . Applying the same reasoning as in B), there exists a path from i to x that is disjoint from the edge (i, j). Likewise, there exists a path from j to x that is disjoint from the edge (i, j). Therefore there exist a path from i to j that is disjoint from (i, j). Step 2: Step 1 has shown that every two nodes are connected by a cycle. Let us assume the longest shortest cycle connecting two nodes is of length l > 2 + 2cB > 3, namely there exists a cycle (x0, x1, x2, ..., x\u230al/2\u230b, ...xl, x0). By establishing the link (x0, x\u230al/2\u230b) the cost of player x0 due to distances from other players is reduced by at least (l2 \u22121 + mod(l + 1, 2)) /4, hence the link will be established as \u2206C \ufffd x0, E + (x0, x\u230al/2\u230b \ufffd \u2264 \ufffd l2 \u22121 + mod(l + 1, 2) \ufffd \u2212cB \u22640 and similarly \u2206C \ufffd x0, E + (x0, x\u230al/2\u230b \ufffd \u22640 . Since d(i.j) \u2264d\u2032(i.j) \u2264l the proof is complete. If there exist players with no two disjoint paths in an equilibrium, then the social cost becomes unbounded. This immediately results in an unbounded Price of Anarchy, as indicated by the following theorem. Theorem 21. Consider a network such that TB \u226bTA \u226b1. The Price of Anarchy is as follows: A) In a setting with asymmetric reliability requirements (\u03c4 = 0): unbounded. B) In a setting with symmetric reliability requirements (\u03c4 \u0338= 0): bounded by o(c). Proof: A) We shall prove this by showing that there exists a stable equilibrium with unbounded social cost. Consider a network in which the major players (type-A players) form a clique, while every minor player is connected only to a single type-A player j \u2208TA.

Consider\nProof: A) We shall prove this by showing that there exists a stable equilibrium with unbounded social cost. Consider a network in which the major players (type-A players) form a clique, while every minor player is connected only to a single type-A player j \u2208TA. We shall show that this network is stabilizable. As discusses before, the type-A clique is stable. Consider\n# \u2208TB. By forming the link (i, x) the change of cost of player x \u2208TA, x \u0338= j is\n\u2206C(x, ix) = cA \u22121 > 0.\nHence, this link will be formed. No additional links between minor players will be established, since such a link only reduces the distance between the participating parties by one, cB \u22121 > 0 and does not provide an additional disjoint path to the type-A clique. Therefore, the social cost is S = \u03c9(Q) \u2192\u221e. B) The total cost due to the inter-connectivity of the type-A clique is identical for all link stable equilibria and is |TA| (|TA| \u22121) (c + (1 + \u03b4/2) A). This cost is composed of |TA\u22121| links per node, and the distance cost to every other major nodes,\nd(i, j) + d\u2032(i, j) = 1 + \u03b4/2.\nNext, we evaluate the cost due to the type-B nodes inter-distances. According to Lemma 20, both d(i, j) \u22644cB and d\u2032(i, j) \u22644cB, so the cost due to the inter-distances between a type-B player and every other player is bounded from above by 4cB (|TA| + |TB|). When summed up over all minor players, this contributes a term 4cB|TB| (|TA| + |TB|) to the social cost. Likewise, the cost of links that at least one of their ends is a type B player is at most cB|TB| (|TA| + |TB|). Therefore, the maximal cost in all link stable equilibria is bounded from above by\nTA| (|TA| \u22121) (c + (1 + \u03b4/2) A) + 5cB|TB| (|TA| + |TB|) .\nThe optimal network configuration is described in Proposition 19. It is straightforward to evaluate the social cost in this configuration. The distance cost due to inter-distances of the type-B players is\nwhile the cost of all links which connect type-B players to type-A players is\nwhile the cost of all links which connect type-B players to type-A players is\n|TB||TA| (cB + cA) .\nFinally, the social cost due to the type-A clique remains the same, so finally we obtain tha he minimal social cost is\nSoptimal = |TA| (|TA| \u22121) (c + (1 + \u03b4/2) A) +2|TB| (|TB \u22121) + 2|TB||TA| (cB + cA)\nBy taking the limits |TA| \u2192\u221e, |TB|/|TA| \u2192\u221ewe obtain that PoA \u22645cB/2. A stable equilibrium with infinite social cost can be easily achieved by considering a network where all minor players are connected to a single, designated, major player. There exists a single path of at most two hops between every minor player to every major player. However, as the stability requirements are asymmetric, the major players have no incentive to establish additional routes to any minor player, and the reliability requirements of the minor players remain unsatisfied. If monetary transfers are feasible, players may compensate other players for the cost of additional links such that all the additional constraints are satisfied. Therefore, in this setting, in contrast to the previous setting, there always exists a fallback route between every two players, regardless of the symmetric or asymmetric nature of the additional survivability constraints. Hence, symmetry is less important than in the previous scenario. Furthermore, the following result suggests that every player is connected to every other player by a cycle, and that the maximal cycle length decays with the number of major players. As the number of ASs increases in time, this predicts that the maximal cycle length should decrease in time. We shall verify this prediction in Section V. Proposition 22. Assume 1 < c < A/2 . Then, every two players are connected by a cycle, and the maximal cycle length is bounded by\nProof: Lemma 20 showed that the maximal distance between players is bounded. We are going to tighten this result in the regime where monetary transfers are feasible. Denote the maximal distance between a type-A player and a type B player by kA. First, we are going to show that the maximal cycle length connecting a major player and a minor player is 2kA + 1. This follows from a simple geometric argument. Consider two players, i \u2208TA and j \u2208TB. Assume kA > 2. If the cycle length is 2kA + 2 or greater, there exists a\ntype-B node that its distance kA+1, in contradiction to the assumption that the maximal distance between a major player and and a minor player is kA. Denote the maximal distance between two minor players by kB. A similar argument shows that maximal cycle length between two minor players is 2kB + 1. Next, are going to show that the maximal distance connecting a major player and a minor player is kA \u2264l \u2264max \ufffd 2 \ufffd\ufffd (A|TA|)2 + 5c \u2212A|TA| \ufffd , 2 \ufffd . We prove by negation. Assume that the distance between player j \u2208TA and i \u2208TB is l. Denote the nodes on the path as (x0 = i, x1, x2...., xl = j). Then, by establishing a link between them, the distance between j and {x0, x1....x\u230al/2\u230b} (similarly, and distance between player i and players {x\u2308l/2\u2309...xl\u22121}) is reduced. In addition, player i reduces its distance to every node of the type-A clique by l. Lemma 25 of [23] shows that the total reduction in distance is (l2 \u22121 + mod(l + 1, 2)) /4. Then, by establishing the link (i, j) we have\n# \u2206C(i, E + ij) + \u2206C(j, E + ij) \u2264cA + cB \u22122 \ufffd l2 \u22121 \ufffd \u2212lA|T\nand as l \u22652 \ufffd\ufffd (A|TA|)2 + 5c \u2212A|TA| \ufffd this expression is negative. Therefore, the link will be established, and the maximal shortest distance between a major player and a minor player is smaller than l. This concludes the proof.\nIV. DYNAMIC ANALYSIS\nThe Internet is a rapidly evolving network. In fact, it may very well be that it would never reach an equilibrium as ASs emerge, merge, and draft new contracts among them. Therefore, a dynamic analysis is a necessity. We first define the dynamic rules. Then, we analyze the basin of attractions of different states, indicating which final configurations are possible and what their likelihood is. We shall establish that reasonable dynamics converge to just a few equilibria. Furthermore, we investigate the speed of convergence, and show that convergence time is linear in the number of players. Lastly, we identify prevalent network motifs [30], i.e., small sub-graphs that emerge during the natural evolution of the network, that arise due to survivability constraints. In Section V we show that these motifs are indeed ubiquitous in the real AS topology, and that the frequency of their occurrences is few folds more than expected in a random network.\nWe split the game into turns, where at each turn only a single player is allowed to remove or initiate the formation of links. At each point in time, or turn, the players that already joined the game form a subset N \u2032 \u2282TA\u222aTB. We shall implicitly assume that the cost function is calculated with respect to the set N \u2032 of players that are already present in the network. Each turn is divided into moves, at each of which a player either forms or removes a single link. A player\u2019s turn is over when it has no incentive to perform additional moves. Note that disconnections of several links can be done unilaterally and hence iteratively. During player\u2019s i turn, all the other players will act in a greedy, rather than strategic, manner. For example, although it may be that player j prefers that a link (i, j\u2032) would be established for some j\u2032 \u0338= j, it will accept the establishment of the less favorable link (i, j), as long as its formation is beneficial to it. In other words, the active player has the advantage of initiation and the other players react to its offers. There are numerous scenarios in which players cannot fully forecast other players\u2019 moves and offers, e.g., when information is asymmetric or when only partial information is available [27]. In these settings, it is likely that a greedy strategy will become the modus operandi of many players. This is a prevalent strategy also when the system evolves rapidly and it is difficult to assess the current network state and dynamics. Formally, we express this dynamic rule as follows. Definition 23. Dynamic Rule #1: Assume it is player i\u2019s turn and let the set of links at its mth move be denoted as Em. In player i\u2019s mth move, it may remove a link (i, j) \u2208Em or, if player j agrees, it may establish the link (i, j) /\u2208Em. Player j would agree to establish (i, j) iff C(j; Em + (i, j)) \u2212C(j; Em) < 0. In a dynamic network formation game, a key question is: Can a player temporarily disconnects itself from the graph, only to reconnect after getting to a better bargaining position? Or must a player stay connected? If the timescale in which the costs are evaluated is comparable to the timescale in which the dynamics occur, then, clearly, a player will not disconnect from the network voluntarily. However, if the latter is much shorter, it may, for a very brief time, disconnect itself from the graph in order to perform some strategic move. If player i cannot temporarily increase its cost, then it will only act such that on each move (rather than on each\nturn) its cost will reduce. The following rules address the two alternative limits. Definition 24. Dynamic Rule #2a: A link (i, j) will be added if i asks to form this link and C(j; Em + ij) < C(j; Em). In addition, any link (i, j) can be removed in move m. Dynamic Rule #2b: In addition to Dynamic Rule #2a, at the end of its move is cost is reduced. Namely, player i may remove a link (i, j) only if C(i; Em \u2212ij) < C(i; Em) and may establish a link (i, j) if both C(j; Em + ij) < C(j; Em) and C(i; Em + ij) < C(i; Em) If the game follows the stricter Dynamic Rule #2b, a player\u2019s cost must be reduced at each move, hence such multi-move plan is not possible. Finally, the following lemma will be useful in the next section. Lemma 25. Assume N players act consecutively in a (uniformly) random order at integer times, which we\u2019ll denote by t. the probability P(t) that a specific player did not act k\u2208N times by t \u226bN decays exponentially.
