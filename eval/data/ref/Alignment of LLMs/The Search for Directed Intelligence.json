In this  blind beacon and blind search strategy the civilization does not need to know where we are nor do  we need to know where they are. This same basic strategy can be extended to extragalactic distances.

INTRODUCTION\nOne of humanities most profound questions is \u201care we alone\u201d. This continues to literally  obsess much of humanity from the extremely diverse backgrounds and interests from scientific,  philosophical and theological. Proof of the existence of other forms of life would greatly influence  all of humanity. The great difficulty in finding life is that our physical exploration (planets  physically explored) is woefully inadequate with a fractional search currently of order 10-20 since the  number of planets, based on the recent Kepler data and the estimated number of stars, in our  universe is estimated to be of order 1020-24 and we have visited of order unity planets. For the  foreseeable future we lack the ability to physically search much beyond this. With remote sensing, as  has been the domain of traditional SETI programs, we can greatly expand this search fraction  assuming that there are other civilizations with comparable or greater technological evolution to our  own AND that such civilizations are actively seeking detection in parts of the electromagnetic  spectrum we can search in. All such remote sensing searches require us to make assumptions that  may have no basis in reality. Hence the great difficulty in converting searches to statements on the  existence of life beyond our own. But it is all we have to go on and hence it should be pursued  consistent with reasonable levels of effort. A detection would forever change humanity while an  upper limit based on our assumptions has only a modest effect. This is truly a \u201chigh risk, high  payoff\u201d area of inquiry and always has been. As always we are \u201cnow\u201d centric and  \u201canthropomorphic\u201d centric in that we expect all other advanced civilizations to be like minded in  their desire to answer the same profound question AND to go about searching in a similar manner.  However, if all civilizations \u201clistened\u201d but did not \u201cspeak\u201d there would be a profound universal  silence. Hopefully, other advanced civilizations do not share our relative silence. A serious and \nimportant question is to envision our time evolution of detection by other civilizations. Our ability to  seriously ponder the issue of remote sensing of life has only become possible in the last 100 years.  This represents about 1% of civilized human existence , less than 0.1% of total human existence,  less than 10-7 of life on Earth and less than 10-8 since the first stars and galaxies formed. While  predictions are fraught with uncertainty, especially those concerning the future, it is somewhat easier  to look into the recent past at our technological progress in relevant areas.   \n# 2. TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT \nOne of the enabling technologies that is relevant is the extremely dramatic progress in solid state  lasers and in particular to laser amplifiers that can be arrayed into larger elements. The latter point is  the analog of phased array radar that is becoming more common. An analogous revolution is taking  place in visible and near IR coherent systems allowing for free space beam combining with no upper limit to power. This is very much analogous to the revolution in computing that has been brought  about by parallel processing where large arrays of modest processors are now ubiquitous for super  computing with no upper limit to computation. There is a very close analogy both technologically  and in system design to the use of large arrays of modest phased arrays (parallel processing) lasers to form an extremely large directed energy system. Indeed the typical doubling time for performance in the semiconductor computational domain per computational element (CPU) is approximately 1.5-2  years  over nearly 5 decades of time. We plot the power from CW fiber lasers as an analog to the  CPU, and see the doubling time over the last 25 years has been approximately 1.7 years or 20  months. This is remarkably similar to \u201cMoore\u2019s Law\u201d and has not hit a plateau yet. CPU speed hit a  plateau for Si devices nearly a decade ago and the path forward has been to increase the number of  processors \u2013 ie to go toward parallel computer. You are likely reading this on such a CPU. Our  current technology (early 2015)  is above 1 Kw in a single mode fiber per amplifier with the analog  of multi core CPU\u2019s being multi spectral injection with many fiber amplifiers per single mode fiber  which now exceeds 30 Kw per fiber. It is estimated that this can be pushed to beyond 100 Kw per  single mode fiber in the near future. We assume that other civilization possess the basic technology  of arrayed (parallel) directed energy systems below but we only assume 1 Kw per fiber that we have  already achieved. The efficiency of laser amplifiers is nearly 50% and thus only modest efficiency  improvement is possible since we are already within a factor of two of unity. The power density is  currently at about 5kg/kw and will drop to about 1 kg/kw in the next few years. All of this is a  remarkable statement about our current technological capability in directed energy systems.  As we  will see we now possess the capability to deploy this technology in a way that enables us to direct  energy for revolutionary purposes one of which is to be \u201cseen\u201d across the entire universe.  This is  truly a remarkable statement. The question that is relevant here is \u201cif there are other advanced  civilization do they have similar capabilities\u201d and if so are they directing it to us? We have never  been in a technological state where we could make such a statement and hence it is logical to explore its ramifications in many areas, SETI being one of them. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/c1ec/c1ec47fd-d057-4b26-b65e-2a7aac3ec039.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1 \u2013 Fiber laser CW output power vs year over the past 25 years based on data in the literature.</div>\n# 3. CIVILIZATION CLASSES AND SIGNAL LEVEL\nAll SETI programs require assumptions about the technological expertise of the civilizations  being sought out[1,2,3]. A number of searches have looked for optical signatures, though few  were able to be done systematically due to practical and funding limitations [4-13]. We will  assume that the civilizations we are seeking have directed energy capability to equals or exceed  our currently and reasonably projected capability in the near future. This is a modest assumption  given the rapid advances in this area and we will see that we already possess the basic  technology to see and be seen across the entire horizon. In particular we will assume that the  civilizations possess the ability to build the equivalent of our DE-STAR program, namely phased  arrays of lasers. This allows for a significant advances beyond what has previously been done  and has the long term capability allowing extremely large systems. It is this latter that  dramatically changes the SETI analysis. We assign the same civilization classifications (denoted  as S) scheme as we use for the DE-STAR array classification where the civilization class  indicates both the power level and beam size of the emitted laser. We assume a standard DESTAR (S) with nominal Earth like solar illumination (FE =1400 w/m2 at the top of the  atmosphere) and a square laser array size (d) where d(m)=10S and beam divergence full angle \u03b8=  2 \u03bb(m)/d(m) = 2 \u03bb10-S  and solid angle \u2126(st)= \u03b82 =4 \u03bb2 10-2S  for small angles . The power is  assumed to be CW rather than pulsed with a value of approximate P(kw) =1.4 \u03b5c 102S where \u03b5c is  the conversion efficiency of solar to laser power (effpv * effde). \nThe critical observable is the flux (w/m2) at the (Earth) telescope and this is the transmit power P (w)/L2 \u2126 where L(m) is the (luminosity) distance. Thus the critical ratio at given distance is  P(w)/ \u2126(st). For a DE-STAR system of class S we have   P(w)/ \u2126(st) = FE \u03b5c 102S/4 \u03bb2 10-2S  =1400 \u03b5c 102S/4 \u03bb2 10-2S = 350 \u03b5c  \u03bb-2 104S.   We can thus calculate the civilization class S from any system with a given power and solid  angle, even if not a DE-STAR class system, as:   \n# S = \u00bc Log10 ([P(w)/ \u2126(st)]/( 350 \u03b5c  \u03bb-2)) = \u00bc Log10 ([P(w)/ \u2126(st)]/( 175  \u03bb-2)).\nWe assume \u03b5c = 0.5 total conversion efficiency of solar (stellar) illumination to laser output. This is about a factor of two higher than our current state of the art for CW systems (present  efficiency of concentrated space solar is 50% and laser efficiency is above 50% for the most  efficient systems). \nefficient systems).  For reference a class 0 civilization would possess the equivalent of a 1 meter diameter optical  system transmitting approximately 1 kw while a class 4 civilization would be able to build a 10  km array with transmitting approximately 100 Gw and a class 11 civilization would be able to  harness the power of a star like our Sun and convert it into directed energy. A class 5 civilization  would be similar in this sense to a Kardashev Type I while a class 11 civilization would be  similar in this sense to a Kardashev Type II or similar to civilization that can harness a typical  star. We are currently about a class 1.5 civilization and rising rapidly. We already have the  technological capability to rise to a class 4 civilization in this century should we choose to do so.  As one example, two class 3 and above civilizations can \u201csee\u201d each other across the entire  horizon modulo the time of flight. Here we use the term (entire horizon) to refer to high redshift  galaxies we feel have had sufficient time to develop life. This is discussed further below. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4b73/4b73f253-ba5b-42f7-bff6-405109c300ce.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2 \u2013 Civilization class and laser emitted power level (CW). </div>\nFlux and Magnitude Equivalents vs Civilization Class and Distance - We can now compute the  flux at the Earth from a distant civilization which we show in Figure 3. The distances are the  effective \"luminosity distance\" which at non cosmological distances is simply the normal Euclidean  distance we are used to measuring. At cosmologically significant distances we need to use the  cosmological correction reflecting the geometry of our universe. This is discussed and computed  below. It is helpful to also think of the received flux in terms of the equivalent photometric  magnitude that is commonly used in astronomy. We show this in Figure 4 as a rough indication of  how \"bright\" the signal is. The equivalent magnitude is computed as if the signal were uniformly  distributed over the typical photometric bandwidth of R~ 4. Of course the laser lines we look for are  much narrower so we have vastly less background that in a photometric band. Nonetheless this is  instructive when comparing to the common language of magnitudes in astronomy. As can be seen at the distance of the typical Kepler planets (~ 1 kly distant) a class 4 civilization (operating near  1\uf06dm)  appears as the equivalent of a mag~0 star (ie the brightest star in the Earth's nighttime  sky), at 10 kly it would appear as about mag ~ 5,  while the same civilization at the distance of  the nearest large galaxy (Andromeda) would appear as the equivalent of a m~17 star. The  former is easily seen with the naked eye (assuming the wavelength is in our detection band)  while the latter is easily seen in a modest consumer level telescope.   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/518d/518df8ce-97ab-4704-9002-1163009a21b5.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">  Figure 3 \u2013 Photon flux at Earth vs civilization class and distance.

ATTENUATION AND GRAVITATIONAL LENSING</div>\n# 4.1 K Corrections due to dust and gas\nGas and dust in interstellar and intergalactic space absorb and scatter radiation. This is sometimes  known as \u201creddening\u201d since the SED from distant stars and galaxies is shifted towards the red  portion of the spectrum as the dust preferentially absorbs and scatters  the shorter wavelength light  (the \u201cbluer part\u201d) and allows more of the longer wavelength portion (the \u201credder portion\u201d to pass  through. This is analogous to the reddening of the sun at sunset. The details of this process depend  on the form and distribution function of the dust grains. Normally objects are studied whose host  spectrum is assumed to be known and the observed spectrum is a measure of the dust. The difference  between the as observed and as emitted vs wavelength is known as the \u201cK correction\u201d. K is  conventionally given in magnitudes and depends on wavelength, direction of the target and distance  to the target. It is also conventional to use a K correction to take account of the atmospheric  transmission discussed below. In general the shorter wavelengths are absorbed more by dust and gas  while the longer IR wavelengths are much less affected. The interaction with neutral gas is generally  quite small except when the photon energies are above an ionization energy which is not the case in  the IR except for very rare cases highly excited states. Ionized gas in the ISM and IGM is another  source of interaction between photons and matter (primarily electrons here) but the densities on  average are low enough that this is not a serious concern except in (rare) highly compact regions.   \n0 0 ( ) flux without dust andgas ( ) flux withintervening dust andgas ( ) magnitudewithout dust andgas ( ) magnitudewithintervening dust andgas ( ) attenuation coefficient from dust andgas ( ) correction magni F F m m K K \uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf061\uf06c \uf06c \uf03d \uf03d \uf03d \uf03d \uf03d \uf03d ( ) 0 tude due to intervening dust andgas Note that ( )depends on the target direction and distance ( ) / ( )  transmission Since magnitude differences are defined as the log of flux ratios we have: ( F F e K \uf061\uf06c \uf061\uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf02d \uf03d \uf0ba ( ) 0 0 0 ( ) ( )/2.5log(e 0 ) ( ) ( ) 2.5log[ ( ) / ( )] 2.5log[ ] 2.5 ( )log( ) ~1.086 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) {hence the term K correction} The transmission thru the dust and gas is given by: ( ) / ( ) K m m F F e e m m K F F e e \uf061\uf06c \uf061\uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf061\uf06c \uf061\uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf06c \uf02d \uf02d \uf02d \uf0ba \uf02d \uf0ba\uf02d \uf03d \uf03d \uf03d \uf02b \uf03d \uf03d )   0.921 ( )  ~ K e \uf06c \uf02d   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/6e43/6e438d2a-c6a6-43a9-8770-5fae31833130.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/8752/87523897-ffbb-42e2-91a2-c376d38051bf.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">  Figure 5 - Ratio of extinction coefficient at a given wavelength to the same but in V band (~ 0.5 microns) in our galaxy.

Gravitational lensing is well known but not  on the small angular scales that may be relevant here. In addition there is a time varying component  due to the motion of matter. There are numerous studies of gravitational lensing in the visible as well  as the large scale power spectrum studied by the Planck mission (Planck collab 2016)[15]. The  primary issue here is less the overall deflection of the beam but rather the gravitational focusing and  defocusing that may occur on close approaches to stars (Maccone 2009)[16]. This overall area  requires a more sophisticated simulation for various realizations and will not be covered in this  paper. \n# 5. FUNDAMENTAL BACKGROUNDS\n# 5.1 Backgrounds relevant for detection\nIn order to determine the signal to noise of the return signature it is necessary to understand  e non-signal related sources of photons.  This is generically referred to as the background.  There  e a number of such backgrounds that are important.  Going outward from the detector to the target  d beyond, there is:  \uf0b7 Dark current and \u201creadout noise\u201d associated with the detector  \uf0b7 Thermally generated photons in the optical system, under the assumption that the optical  system is mostly running near 300 K.  \uf0b7 Photon statistics of the received signal.   \uf0b7 Atmospheric emission \u2013 sky glow if the observations are inside the Earths atmosphere.  \uf0b7 Solar system dust that both scatters sunlight and emits from its thermal signature.  Dust in the  solar system is typically at a temperature of about 200 K.  This is generically called Zodiacal  scattering and emission, respectively, or simply Zodiacal light. This assumes a mission inside  the solar system. We assume that there is a similar level of equivalent dust in the host  civilization \u201csolar system\u201d  \uf0b7 Distant background stars that are in the field of view  \uf0b7 Sunlight scattered into the field of view for targets that are near to the sun in the field of  view.  This is generally only important for targets that are very close to the sun along the line  of sight, though off axis response of the optical system can be an issue as well.  \uf0b7 Scattered galactic light from dust and gas in our galaxy.  \uf0b7 The far IR background of the universe, known as the Cosmic Infrared Background or CIB.  This is the total sum of all galaxies (both seen and unseen) in the field of view in the laser  band. \n\uf0b7 The Cosmic Background Radiation or remnant radiation from the early universe.  This i negligible for short wavelengths. \nIn all of these cases the fact that the laser linewidth (bandwidth) is extremely narrow (from kHz to GHz depending on the laser design) and the field of view is extremely narrow, mitigates these effects which would otherwise be overwhelming for a broadband photometric band survey. Heterodyning is also possible could be used in the future but is not assumed as we do not posses large focal plane arrays of such detectors.   \n# 5.2 Cosmic IR Background - CIB \nThe CIB was first detected by the Diffuse IR Background Explorer (DIRBE) instrument on  the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite launched in 1989 and studied by numerous other  experiments including the recent Planck mission.[27,28,29,30]  It is an extremely faint background  now thought to be due to the sum of all galaxies in the universe from both the stellar (fusion)  component at short wavelengths near 1 \u03bcm and from the re-radiated dust component near 100 \u03bcm.  On large angular scales (degrees) it is largely isotropic though at very small angular scales (arc sec)  individual sources can be detected.  The diffuse CIB component, using data collected by DIRBE, is  shown in Fig. 6. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/56fa/56fa1409-c1ea-459f-9a3d-391bafb6d5d7.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/75bb/75bb1bbb-8caa-400e-bfb6-dee43a07d978.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">  Figure 6 - Cosmic Infrared Background vs wavelength. Note the contribution from the stellar fusion peak  near 1 micron  and the reradiated dust peak near 100 microns.  </div>\n# 5.3 Zodiacal Light\nLike the CIB the zodiacal light has two components and both involve dust in the solar system  and the Sun.  The sunlight both scatters off the interplanetary dust grains giving a \u201cstreetlight in fog\u201d  effect as well as heating the dust grains which then reradiate in the mid to far IR.  The scattered  component can be seen with the unaided eye in dark extreme latitudes and is sometimes known as  the \u201cGegenschein\u201d and traces the ecliptic plane.  The dust grains are in rough equilibrium through  being heated by the Sun and cooling through their own radiation.  This background is not isotropic  but is highly anisotropic depending on the position and orientation of the observer in the ecliptic  plane.  This was studied in detail by the DIRBE instrument on COBE.[27,28,29]  As seen in Fig.7,  based on some of the DIRBE measurements, the brightness of both the scattered and emitted  components vary dramatically with the observed line of sight relative to the ecliptic plane.  In the  plot the angle relative to the ecliptic plane is given by the ecliptic latitude (Elat) where Elat = 0 is  looking in the plane and Elat = 90 is looking perpendicular.  The situation is even more complex as  the scattered and emitted components vary with the Earth\u2019s position in its orbit around the Sun.  By  comparing the CIB and the Zodiacal light, it is clear that even in the best lines of sight  (perpendicular to the ecliptic plane) the Zodiacal light completely dominates over the CIB.  For the  JWST mission the Zodiacal light is typically the limiting factor for IR observations, for example.  However, since illumination will occur in a system with an extremely narrow laser bandwidth, and  detection occurs with a matched narrow bandwidth (allowing for Doppler shifting) , it is possible to  largely reduce the Zodiacal light and the CIB to negligible levels. This is not generally true for  broadband photometric (typically 30% bandwidth) surveys.     \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4d35/4d35d602-ea92-46ef-93f8-9fb4bc067bdb.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">  Figure 7 - Zodiacal light emission vs wavelength and observing angle relative to the ecliptic plane.

Note the reradiated dust peak near 10 microns.  </div>\n# 5.4 Optics Emission\nThe optical emission from the telescope also needs to be considered. The optics are assumed  to be at roughly 300 K for simplicity (this could be changed in some scenarios), giving a brightness  of about 1\u00d7107 ph/s-m2-sr-\u03bcm for unity emissivity (or for a blackbody emitter) at the baseline  wavelength of 1.06 \u03bcm.  Unity emissivity is clearly an over estimate but represents a worst case.  Under the assumption of a diffraction limited system, the entendue of the optics is such that A \u03a9 =  \u03bb2 ~ 10-12 m2\u2219sr where A is the effective receiving area and \u03a9 is the received solid angle.  The  bandwidth of reception must also be included.  Here a matched filter spectrometer or heterodyning is  assumed (to get Doppler) with a bandwidth equal to the laser linewidth.  As mentioned above, this is  typically104 - 1010 Hz or approximately 4\u00d710-11 to 4\u00d710-5 \u03bcm.  The total per sub element is thus an  emission of about 4\u00d710-16 to 4\u00d710-10 ph/s again for an emissivity of 1.  This is an extremely small  rate compared to the other backgrounds (air glow, Zodi, CIB) as well as the signal itself. Comparing  the optics emission of 1\u00d7107 ph/s-m2-sr-\u03bcm for unity emissivity to the CIB and Zodiacal light shows  the CIB and Zodiacal light are both much larger than the optics emission.   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/3735/37354135-da07-423a-84cb-91b1ecc4ba69.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 8 - Optical emission assuming unity emissivity.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/31ff/31ffb81d-f4c9-4546-98c3-a596740e451c.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 9 - Optical emission assuming a diffraction limited optical system.</div>\n# 5.5 Atmospheric Transmission and Radiance\nFor studies inside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere we need to consider the transmission and emission of the  atmosphere. We consider the transmission and thermal radiance of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere for  different observation scenarios from sea level, to high mountain observatories to aircraft and finally  stratospheric balloons. There are a number of observational windows that allow us to observe in the  visible and IR that must be taken into account to optimize a search strategy especially one at high  redshift. We will see that observations at high redshift become feasible for some scenarios. In  addition to atmospheric thermal radiance we consider non thermal processes below as well as  anthropomorphic produced lines.   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/02d9/02d9762e-688a-470e-8fb7-9b3a27f5b04e.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/9790/97900e1a-ac0e-4e4f-a3bb-35e2bf2a525a.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 11 - Thermal emission from optics, atmospheric thermal radiance, CIB and Zodiacal light in the ecliptic plane (0) at 4 degrees relative to the plane (45) and perpendicular to the plane (90).

In particular various atomic and molecular transitions are excited  by the solar wind and other energetic phenomenon. In the visible and IR there are a variety of non  LTE lines that are highly time variable include Oxygen and OH emission. In general these have  modest low spatial frequency variations but the variable background rates will be an issue at  extremely low intensities. OH emission originates at altitudes above 80km typically and is most  problematic in J (1.1-1.3 microns) and H (1.5-1.8 microns) bands with some in K (2-2-4 microns)  band. Rousellot et al (2000) have computed the theoretical OH spectra of 4732 lines from 0.6 to 2.6  microns and spectrometers at major telescope measure the brighter OH lines. As mentioned the OH  line emission is highly variably both temporally and spatially. OH lines are extremely narrow  (unresolved at R=10,000 where R=\uf06c/\u0394\uf06c) and while there are many lines they occupy a very small  fraction of the spectrum due to their narrow linewidth. There is also a very large dynamic range in  predicted OH line emission (over 14 orders of magnitude). Only the brighter lines are typically  visible and longward of 2.6 and shortward of 0.6 there is very little OH emission. We also show a  zoom in near the 1.064 micron Yb transition that is the baseline for our larger DE-STAR system as  an example of the narrow nature of the lines and their spacing near the Yb line. This is one example.  Fortunately we can achieve some additional rejection of OH due to the assumed point like structure  of the source we are looking for while OH is spatially broad so some spatial filtering will be useful. \nThis is analogous to photometry determination of the local sky background in aperture photometry.  Comparing OH emission in J and H bands it is clear that the OH lines dominate when using broad  band filters while in the visible bands and beyond K band OH lines become sub dominant. This  applies to ground based measurements while for space based measurements OH lines are not  relevant. Since the OH lines are very narrow reducing the filter bandwidth does not allow us to  completely mitigate them until we get to extremely narrow band filters or use an IFU both of which  are problematic. Note that in a filter bandwidth the total OH emission is the sum of all the OH lines  within the band. The use of aperture photometry and synthetic sky techniques will help us model and  reduce the effects of OH line emission (as with all large angular scale emission) but we are still left  with the noise from both photon statistics and systematic errors that will need to be taken into  account. In this sense the problem is similar to classical LTE emission from optics and the  atmosphere as well as from the detector but with the added complexity of more challenging temporal  and spatial variations in the OH emission. In the visible bands and beyond 2.4 microns the OH  emission is relatively small. The primary problem occurs between 1 and 2.4 microns. For broad band  photometric systems non thermal emission  dominate out to about 2 microns. For narrow bandwidth  or spectroscopic systems zodiacal emission and scattering dominates out to about 1.5 microns. In the  long run space based searches are preferred. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/3b9a/3b9acbae-b12d-4d03-a1fb-29491fce9936.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">      Figure 12 - Left: Theoretical OH emission lines from 0.6 to 2.6 microns.

This corresponds to a flux of approximately  10-50 photons/s-m2 -sq arc sec. This includes thermal as well as non thermal processes (air glow) ,  zodi, unresolved stars etc. Comparing to the figures above we see this is in reasonable agreement. In  the V band the dominant emission is from Zodi scattering of sunlight as well as non thermal  atmospheric (air glow) processes. As we move towards into IR the thermal emission of the  atmosphere and optics as well as OH lines begin to dominate with OH diminishing beyond K band  (2.4 \u00b5m) . \n# 5.8 Terrestrial illumination\nHuman lighting is an issue but in general is not as severe for our search as it tends to be a relatively  slow temporal and spatial function. Some Hg and Na lines from HID lights are notable and  increasingly LED lighting though the latter is generally broadband due to phosphor coatings. All of  these are site dependent and can be mitigated by observing targets at multiple locations and over  multiple time scales.  \n# 5.9 Stellar and Interstellar line emission\nHost and intervening stellar atmospheres will provide some confusion due to the emission lines and  to a lesser extend from absorption lines. In addition to common know lines we can also check their temporal distribution to see if they are natural or not. Using temporal photon statistics allows us an  additional cross check as well as more conventional tests for unnatural time modulation of possible positive targets. \n# 5.10 Unresolved stellar background\nIn many surveys we will not resolve individual stars and thus will have many stars per pixel. These  unresolved stars will form a background, much like the CIB. Since the stellar distribution in galaxies  is a strong function of position in the galaxy it is unlike the CIB in this sense and is highly spatially  variable. This has implications for the coupling of pointing jitter and seeing variations into our data.  In particular the unresolved stars have emission lines that will form a line background in addition to  the continuum background. For example the dark sky background of 22 mag/sq arc sec in V band  includes the unresolved stellar background among other backgrounds. As one example consider stars  like our Sun. The Sun has an absolute magnitude (apparent magnitude if it were placed at a distance  of 10 pc) of Mv = 4.83 and an apparent magnitude mv vs distance d(pc) of mv(d) = M-5+5log(d(pc)).  Imagine we place the Sun at 10 kpc (approximately the distance from Earth to the galactic center and  about 1/3 the \u201cdiameter of our galaxy). The apparent magnitude of our Sun would then be mv(d=10  kpc) = 19.8. To put this in perspective the photon flux of  mv=0 star is about 1010 \uf067/s-m2 (this  depends on the equivalent temperature of the star). Hence a star with mv=20 (approx that of our Sun  at d=10 kpc) would have a flux of 100 \uf067/s-m2. Our galaxy has an average stellar density of  approximately 1 star/sq arc sec. If our galaxy has a uniform distribution of stars like our Sun all at a  distance of 10 kpc then would expect a stellar flux of about 100 \uf067/s-m2-sq arc sec in V band which is  close to the dark sky flux of about 10-50 \uf067/s-m2-\uf06d-sq arc sec in V band. Since the flux from a laser  associated with a planet near a star and the flux from the parent star both scale inversely with the  square of the distance to the star we will see that the stellar flux is a relatively small noise source  when we calculate signal to noise ratios. Note that for a diffraction limited system (1 pol) A\u2126=\uf06c2 .  As the unresolved stellar background signal is proportion to both the telescope area and solid angle  (per pixel) the total signal for the diffraction limited case is independent of the telescope size. \n# 5.11 Unresolved galactic signatures\nAlong any given direction we will have a number of distant galaxies in a pixel for ground based  surveys as well as small aperture space based surveys. This is basically the CIB but in this instance  there is an additional component to the usual CIB in that each galaxy has some billion to trillion  possible civilizations. On average in a square arc second, typical of ground based seeing without  adaptive optics, we will have an unresolved and undetected distant galaxy at an unknown redshift.  \n# 5.12 High Redshift surveys \nWe can detect civilizations at a variety of redshifts and this poses unique opportunities and  challenges. For higher civilization classes we can detect them at any redshift which is both good and  problematic for our detection algorithm.

There is relatively little difference in the models for luminosity distance even ignoring dar\nenergy at low redshift. The distances we normally quote are luminosity distances even if just labeled  distance. We also show cosmological age vs redshift and cosmological age vs luminosity distance.  By redshift z=5 the age of the universe is only about 1.2 Gyr. If life does not evolve rapidly after star  formation then there would not be sufficient time to evolve technologically advanced civilizations  capable of emitting detectable directed energy signatures. The luminosity distance at z=5 is about 47  Gpc corresponding to a Euclidean distance of about 150 Gly. While still detectable for some higher  civilization classes the time for advanced technological evolution is short. Correspondingly at z=1  the cosmological age is about 5.8 Gyr corresponding to a luminosity distance of about 6.7 Gpc  allowing much more time for life to evolve. For reference our evolution on Earth is about 3-4 Gyr.  We also show the comoving volume of the universe vs the redshift we observe to as well as the  normalized comoving volume explored to a given z relation to z=20 where we chose z=20 to be a  reasonable approximation for the first stars and planets. Note that z=20 contains the vast majority of  the volume of our horizon but that z=20 is only about 150 Myr after the beginning and this is likely  not sufficient time for intelligent life to form. If we assume intelligent life needs 4.5 Gyr to form  (approximately our evolution time after the formation of the solar system) this would correspond to  about z~1.5.  We also show the normalized comoving volume normalized to z=1.5. The normalized  comoving volume is essentially the fraction of the accessible universe where we might expect to find  technologically advanced life based on our own evolution. These are obviously large assumptions on  our part. We use a concordance model (2015 Planck) which yields a current age of around 13.8 Gyr.  \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4386/43862318-9d53-4368-b56d-c7419d3108bf.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 14 - Luminosity vs Redshift for several cosmological models.

Laser lines as  narrow as 1 Hz or even less have been demonstrated. For current high power laser amplifiers the  bandwidth is typically at the 0.1-1 KHz level but to achieve the highest power levels this is  artificially broadened to about 10 GHz/Kw , at a wavelength near 1 micron,  to overcome the  Stimulated Brillion Scattering (SBS) limits in the fibers. There is no intrinsic reason this broadening  needs to be implemented but is done due to current technological limitations.  Indeed, if lower power  per fiber amplifiers are used and indeed at the 10-100 watt amplifier level bandwidths below 1 KHz  are already achievable. The bandwidth language of lasers is usually given in Hz while the  astronomical language of bandwidth is usually discussed in microns or nanometer. The relationship  between the two is simply \u0394\u03bb=c\u03bd-2 \u0394\u03bd. The effective spectroscopic resolution is defined as R=\u03bb/ \u0394\u03bb  = \u03bd/ \u0394\u03bd. To put this in perspective a laser line at 1 micron (\u03bd~ 300 THz) with a 1 Hz bandwidth  (mixing units is typical in this field unfortunately) has an R ~ 3x1014 . By astronomical standards of  spectrometers this is a phenomenally large R. Even with the current broadened SBS limit mitigation  techniques of 10 GHz/Kw the effective R ~ 30,000 for a 1 Kw fiber amplifier at 1 micron. The  current state of the art for astronomical spectrometers whether fiber fed or free space is about 104 105. Heterodyne spectroscopy is now becoming possible at optical and IR wavelengths and offers  much higher R for the future if needed.   In the accompanying plot we show the laser linewidth (usually quoted in Hz) to the equivalent width  in microns. We have chosen a wavelength of 1.06 microns for convenience. It corresponds to a  particularly efficient Yb transition we are using as the baseline for the DE-STAR program but it is  representative of any system. In this case the bandwidth in microns also corresponds to the  equivalent \u03b2 = v/c. While sources and receivers are in relative motion the effect is to shift the central \nline not to broaden it since the systems we envision are localized.

It is  useful to compare the radiance (w/m2-st) for a laser and for a star when both are integrated over their  respective areas and over the linewidth or filter bandwidth. In this way we compare to emitters at  their source assuming the laser is associated with a planet near a star.  For simplicity we model the star as a thermal source.    The brightness is then  \u03bb        \u03bb       \u03bb          (W/(m2-sr-m)). We then integrate this over the forward  facing hemisphere of the star and over the linewidth and compare to the laser for a given civilization  class. As an example we compare the brightness of our Sun, modeled as a 5700 K blackbody,  at a  wavelength of 1.06 microns and get   9 MW/m2/sr-\u00b5m. With a diameter of 1.4x109 m this gives 1.4x1025 w/sr- \u00b5m. The relationship  between wavelength and frequency bandwidth \u0394\u03bb=c\u03bd-2 \u0394\u03bd at 1.06 microns is \u0394\u03bb(\u00b5m)=4x10-15 \u0394\u03bd  (Hz). Assuming a laser linewidth of 1 kHz (typical for current state of the art modest power (~ 0.1  KW) amplifiers) this would yield \u0394\u03bb(\u00b5m)=4x10-12 . For current high power amplifiers (KW class)  that are SBS limit artificially broadened with a linewidth of 1010 Hz this yields \u0394\u03bb(\u00b5m)=4x10-5. Both  of these are small linewidths by astronomical standards but not by laser standards. Both linewidths  currently exist in the relevant technology. However the primary effect of directed energy is in fact  that it is directed. For example a class S civilization has a laser array size (d) where d(m)=10S and  beam divergence full angle \u03b8 = 2 \u03bb/d with a projected solid angle of approximately   \nSince the laser line is very narrow it is important to understand how the \u201cin-band\u201d received flux integrated over the bandwidth of the line from the laser compares to natural sources of radiation.

The resolved case only applies for a large receiving array with a very nearby star and is generally not of interest as we do not think life is associated with the itself. With a linewidth of 1 KHz (\u0394\u03bb(\u00b5m)=4x10-12) this gives 4x10-17 w and 4x10-10 w for a linewidth of 10 GHz.   In case 1) we treat the Sun as a prototype for a distant star, one that is unresolved in our telescope (due to seeing or diffraction limits) but one where the stellar light ends up in ~ one pixel of our detector. Clearly the laser is vastly brighter in this sense. Indeed for the narrower linewidth the laser is much brighter than an entire galaxy in this sense.  For very narrow linewidth lasers (~ 1 Hz) the laser can be nearly as bright as the sum of all stars in the universe within the linewidth.

Even  modest directed energy systems can stand out as the brightest objects in the universe within  the laser linewidth. \n# 5.15 Orbital considerations and optimal detection bandwidth\nAs we do not apriori know the orbital speeds of the targets we are searching for we need to consider  the optimum search strategy. There is also the issue of the bulk speed of the galaxy the target is  embedded in. The shorter term, but predictable, orbital velocity variations due to the rotations of the  Earth, orbit of the Earth around the Sun etc and the similar but unknown orbital environment of the  target leads to a complex search optimization. Ideally broadband FFT like heterodyne searches will  be possible in the future but we will concentrate on more (currently) practical methods such as using  narrow band filters and IFU\u2019s. For example, if we adopt a series of narrow band filters as one  approach to detection then one of the fundamental techniques is to temporally \u201cchop\u201d the spectral  bands so that the Doppler shift due to orbital shifts during the period of observing for  the shift over  this period is small compared to the filter bandwidth. For example the earth\u2019s rotation speed (~ 1  km/s) yields a Doppler shift of roughly 3x10-6 while the Earth\u2019s revolution around the Sun (~ 30  km/s) gives a Doppler shift of about 10-4. The time scales of these is very different being 1 day and 1  year respectively. Our typically observing times for a complete series of filters will be typically  measured in hours so spectral chop period is even less than one rotation of the Earth. The equivalent  for the target is completely unknown but we assume a comparable situation both for simplicity and  based on the issue of habitability and known detected exo-planets.  \n# 5.16 Detection Bandwidth and Background Noise levels\nTo achieve the maximum signal to noise ratio we need to understand the level of the background noise vs the signal. The optimal filter bandwidth would be large enough to encompass the emitted laser line and any broadening mechanisms but not so wide as to significantly increase the\nbackground noise. On the other hand the filter bandwidth affects the search strategy if individual  filters are used. There is a tradeoff. Ideally a large portion of the both spectral and spatial space  would be simultaneous sampled to give a fast mapping speed. Currently there are no simple  technical solutions consistent with both of these needs. Spectrometers exists with high R but they are  limited to a very modest number of pixels. Our initial search strategy will focus of trading large  simultaneous spatial coverage for large simultaneous spectral coverage. Ideally in the future this will  change. Given all the sources of noise there is a point where having a filter that is too narrow  becomes counter productive. This is the optimization that is required. For example if the filter  bandwidth reduces the background levels to be much less than readout noise in the detector than no  additional gain is added by reducing the filter bandwidth. There is a large parameter space to  tradeoff here and with the target unknown it is simply a subjective trade. Adding in practical  considerations such as telescope time and systems costs pushes the trade to larger filter bandwidths  currently.  Multichroic beam splitters is another option to increase thruput that we are exploring in  addition to other techniques. \n# 5.17 Search Strategies\nTo decide on a search strategy we first need to decide what it is we are looking for. At first this seems obvious (find \u201cunnatural\u201d sources, but the optimum search given limited time and resources is more subtle.  \nTo decide on a search strategy we first need to decide what it is we are looking for. At first this seems obvious (find \u201cunnatural\u201d sources, but the optimum search given limited time and resources is more subtle.  \nModulation detection - One method is to look for sources of temporal or spatial modulation that is  unnatural. If we focus on temporal modulation we think of laser communication modulation. For use  this is typically in the Gbps or nanosecond modulation range. But this is another \u201canthropomorphic  now\u201d mindset. If we are observing at a wavelength around 1 micron the available bandwidth far  exceeds 300 Tbps with proper encoding. We do not currently possess this technology nor is it  obvious that given the time of flight for distances that are astronomically relevant that directed  energy based data communication (streaming of \u201cintelligent\u201d information) would be logical. As  always \u201cwe do what we can do\u201d. Hence searches for high frequency modulation at the reasonable  limits of our current technology does make sense. There is of course no particular reason why  civilization far more advanced that us would be transmitting data in the realm we can detect unless  they are specifically trying to beacon other civilizations. This rapidly degenerates into a nearly  useless philosophy of the unknown. See section below on blind beacons and searches for further  discussion.   Ignoring modulation and searching for narrow but unnatural lines \u2013 Massively parallel search  strategies - Another search option and the baseline we adopt is to search for narrow line emission  that are unnatural and then follow up to determine if these lines contain intelligent information. The  advantage here is we do not depend solely on temporal modulation to search but can observe  extremely large number of possible targets simultaneously without knowledge of their modulation.  In the past several groups have looked for short pulses as an indicator of unnatural sources. The  advantage in this strategy is that high peak power can be produced much more easily in short pulses  but the disadvantage is the average power of terrestrial pulsed lasers is generally significantly lower  than CW systems and from a search strategy we have no apriori knowledge that extra-terrestrial  civilization would use pulsed systems. Indeed on Earth we do not generally use pulsed systems for  communications, though this should not be a guide. For a given amount of average power the SNR is \nnot necessarily higher for a pulsed system. Another and much greater disadvantage to searching for  pulsed signals is that they are usually done with a single pixel on the sky while in the CW search one  can use a large format array detector with multiple megapixels (Gigapixels are possible now) and  thus there is a tremendous parallel advantage to a CW imaging search. Both approaches should be  used.  For example in any square arc second of the sky there is approximately one galaxy even if not  currently known and in this galaxy there are approximately 100 billion solar systems IF the galaxy is  similar in star and planet formation to our own. In a single square degree that are thus about 107  galaxies and some 1018 possible stellar systems. This allows a massively parallel search strategy with  no apriori pointing knowledge though we can directly image nearby galaxies. The fundamental issue  here is to understand the SED (both line and continuum) well enough to model and subtract it. This  then gets to the optimization of the filters. As we will see below, even with modest Earth based  telescope, we can detect some advanced civilization across the entire horizon with current  telescopes.  Sources not directly beamed towards us \u2013 A possibility is that we will \u201ceavesdrop\u201d on a laser  communications system that is not intentionally beamed for other civilization detection. One option  here is accidental line up (glint) that we just happen to intercept. The other option is to detect the  side lobes or possible scattering of the main beam. The basic problem with these latter two is that the  signal we would intercept would be drastically reduced as the typical side lobes and interstellar  scattering is generally extremely small with far off axis side lobes reduced by a factor of 104 to 1010  from the main lobe not being unusual. Scattering of the target of the \u201claser communications\u201d system  is another possibility but this also drastically reduces the observed flux. \n# 5.18 Life at High Redshift\nLife on Earth is thought to have evolved between 3 and 4  billion years ago with what we now call  intelligent life being relatively recent. This puts the beginnings of life at about 1 billion years after  the formation of the Earth. We have little idea of the \u201cwhy\u201d of the evolutionary path that life took  and much was externally influenced by bombardments for example. The first stars in the universe  are thought to have formed within a few hundred million years after the beginning of the universe.  Planet formation presumably was on a similar time scale though the processes needed for life may  have taken significantly longer. The times scales are sufficiently uncertain that we cannot rule out  life at high redshift [14] and this would allow many billions of years more for life to evolve than on  Earth. Our own technological capabilities are an extremely non linear function of time with virtually  no technology being achieved until the 1 part per million. This places us on an extremely nascent  portion of the curve of intelligence and technology. If we imagine not a few thousand years of  technological evolution but a few billion years of this it becomes sobering to contemplate intelligent  life evolving at high redshifts and having billions of years (or a million time more than our  technological time scale) to grow technologically. As we look at any patch of sky, with a typical  square degree field of view,  we will be observing some 10 million galaxies or some 1017 \u2013 1018  possible planets if high redshift planet fractions are similar to today. As shown below we can detect  class 4 and above civilizations at high redshift even with modest ground based (meter class)  telescopes if they transmit in our direction when we are observing.  \nWe model the detection system in a standard way assuming a model for quantum efficiency, dar current, read noise, combined \"sky background\" etc.    \ne S F A Q \uf074 \uf03d    (we assume we have dark field and bias subtracted the image) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 1/2 1/2 2 2 2 2 1/2 1/2 1/2 time 1/2 Note units of are #e  or ( / )  #e S DC DC e DC e e t D t t C e n n N N N N S S S FA Q i n s F A Q H FA F A z Q i Q \uf062 \uf062 \uf062 \uf062 \uf074 \uf074 \uf074 \uf02d \uf02d \uf03d \uf02b \uf02b \uf03d \uf02b \uf02b \uf03d \uf03d \uf02b \uf057 \uf02d \uf02b \uf02b \uf03d \uf02b \uf057 \uf03d\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 1/2 1/2 2 2 2 2 ime 2 t ( ) R T t R e DC e R N N N N FA Q i F A Q N n \uf062 \uf074 \uf074 \uf03d \uf02b \uf03d \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf03d \uf057\nWe define the telescope effective area   note that this includes the quantum effic en i e A A A Q \uf03d\nAt short time scales the S/N increases linearly with integration time \u03c4 since the read noise dominates  the noise and then transitions to increasing as \u03c41/2 at increasing times as the shot noise from the  source backgrounds and dark current begin to dominate. We define the transition time between these two domains as \u03c4c.  \nWe solve for the time to achieve a given S/N as follows: \nWe note that the computation of the SNR above assumes the shot noise from the source also  contributes to the noise term. This is reasonable IF the SNR is computed relative to the pixel the  source is detected in but in most search strategies we will be doing spatial filtering and the SNR  should be computed relative to the nearby pixels that do not have the source term in them.

SIMULATIONS \nWe compute some examples of the SNR for differing civilization classes, distances and hence  redshifts for existing or soon to exist telescopes below. He we include all backgrounds and modest \nseeing and detectors but assume we have narrow enough filters to exclude airglow and OH lines or  that we are in regions where these are minimal.  A more aggressive approach is to assume we use the same technology to receive as is used to  transmit by the civilization target. In the latter case the SNR becomes extremely large across the  entire horizon for space based surveys using this approach with civilizations of class 3 and above  assuming we also become a class 3 civilization.   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/aff7/aff7fce7-d3eb-458b-8cf0-323eddcb218d.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">re 19 - SNR vs distance and civilization class for a</div>\n  Figure 19 - SNR vs distance and civilization class for a 1, 10, 30  meter ground based telescope with a 1000 sec  integration and very modest system assumptions with seeing  of 0.5\" RMS  without adaptive optics, pixel size of 0.5\",  readout noise of 10e, dark current of 1e/s, QE =0.5 and atmospheric transmission of 0.5. The total noise is dominated by  the readout noise and dark current and relatively insensitive to bandwidth. This represents our current (or soon to exist)  capability for modestly wide field imaging.  Our current technology for adaptive optics would be useful for narrow  spatial surveys or follow up but is not currently feasible for wide field (degree class) surveys.  The bottom line for even 1 m class telescopes is that class 3 civilization are detectable across our galaxy, class 4 civilizations are detectable in  nearby galaxies and class 5 civilization are detectable out to modest redshifts. With 10 and 30 m class telescopes the  situation is even more optimistic. A wide field LSST like telescope (8m class) could detect class 4 civilizations out to  high redshift. We can reduce the readout noise to 1e and the dark current to negligible levels if needed and can enter a  photon counting regime for narrow bandwidth cases.  \n# 7.1 \u2013 Space based options \nWhile ground based options are the least costly to implement, space based approaches offer a  number of advantages. There is no atmospheric windows to deal with and the backgrounds drop to  the zodiacal light limit (assuming missions within the solar system). This can dramatically open up  the wavelength search space and offer much greater sensitivity for a given aperture. The main issue  is cost, complexity and aperture limit. The same system we propose for the phased array  transmission in DE-STAR can be used in a bidirectional mode as a receiver as well. If we imagine  we expand our space based capability so that we become a class 2,3 or 4 civilization the ability to \ndetect other distant civilization becomes much greater. One disadvantage in the phased array receive  mode is that the simplest designs are single pixel and thus we lose the advantage of spatial  multiplexing. There are future approaches to the spatial multiplexing problem but they are not yet  practical. Ground based variants of this approach also offer the possibility of extremely large  aperture though with limited number of spatial pixels. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/14e6/14e66771-fd82-4d67-8373-850bafcb591a.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 20 -  Space based mission thermal emission from optics, CIB and Zodiacal light in the ecliptic plane (0) at 45 degrees relativ o the plane (45) and perpendicular to the plane (90).

This trades off spatial resolution for spectral resolution but with the ability to use a spectrometer.  This would be an unusual spectrometer which present challenges in construction but may allow a  higher thruput in some circumstances. Functionally this could be a larger fiber spectrometer.

This would be an unusual spectrometer which present challenges in construction but may allow a  higher thruput in some circumstances. Functionally this could be a larger fiber spectrometer.  Note that the background contribution to the noise term  e B A Q \uf062\uf06c \uf074 \uf044 \uf057 is proportional to the product of spectral bandwidth, aperture area and pixel solid angle  2 \uf06c \uf06c\uf071 \uf044\uf057\uf03d\uf044  and hence we have the same scaling of noise and SNR with bandwidth and with solid angle.    In the case of a diffraction limited telescope we note the background contribution to the noise term  e B A Q \uf062\uf06c \uf074 \uf044 \uf057 is proportional to  A \uf06c \uf044 \uf057. For a diffraction limited telescope the diffraction limited  pixel size (not over sampled) is such that  2 A \uf06c \uf057\uf03d and hence the background noise contribution term is  e B A Q \uf062\uf06c \uf074 \uf044 \uf057 =  2 e B Q \uf062\uf06c \uf074 \uf06c \uf044 .  \nOH lines are unresolved at R=10,000 so there will be a practical tradeoff between observing between OH and air glow lines and fractional \u201cclean\u201d spectral coverage. R=1000 to 10,000 is generally a  practical range. Spectral cross talk with larger pixels will likely be an issue to be explored. Ideally  both a spectrometer and an spatial search using narrow band filters would be employed. This is  allow both rapid and deep searches as well as integral follow up and filtering of atmospheric lines  (for ground based systems).   \n\n",
