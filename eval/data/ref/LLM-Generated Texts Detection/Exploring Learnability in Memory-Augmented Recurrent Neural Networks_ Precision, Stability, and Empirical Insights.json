Architectures such as Elman RNNs, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) [1] are widely used in applications like speech recognition, machine translation, and time-series analysis. However, these models are constrained by their fixed memory capacity, limiting them to recognizing regular languages when implemented with finite precision [2, 3]. To enhance the computational capabilities of RNNs, researchers have explored augmenting them with external memory structures like stacks [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. This approach extends the expressivity of RNNs to context-free languages (CFLs) [11], which are crucial in applications like natural language processing (NLP) where hierarchical structures are prevalent. Memory-augmented models have demonstrated significant improvements in recognizing complex formal languages by simulating operations similar to Pushdown Automata (PDA). These models can process deterministic and nondeterministic context-free languages, thereby expanding the class of languages they can handle compared to traditional RNNs. However, while their theoretical expressivity is well-established, the learnability of these sys-\ntems remains an open challenge. Learnability here refers to the model\u2019s ability to reliably generalize from training data to unseen inputs, particularly with complex recursive patterns. Despite their theoretical advantages, empirical studies indicate that many memory-augmented models struggle to generalize to longer sequences. This instability is likely due to the dynamic nature of memory manipulation and finite precision constraints, leading to performance degradation on extended sequences. Learnability is closely tied to stability: unstable systems are prone to accumulating errors over time, particularly as sequence lengths increase, resulting in unpredictable behavior. Understanding stability conditions is therefore crucial for enhancing learnability. In this work, we investigate how different configurations, such as freezing the RNN controller while training the memory, impact stability and performance compared to fully trainable but unstable setups. Stability, in this context, refers to a model\u2019s ability to maintain consistent performance across varying sequence lengths and input complexities. A stable model efficiently generalizes from training data while remaining robust to variations in input and computational precision. Stability is key to ensuring reliable learnability for complex tasks. Key aspects of stability include: \u2022 Consistency Across Sequence Lengths: Ensuring stable performance on both short and long sequences. \u2022 Robustness to Variability: Handling variations in input and precision without significant performance degradation. \u2022 Reliable Memory Manipulation: Maintaining correct memory operations even under finite precision. \u2022 Enhanced Generalization: Promoting better generalization across different tasks and datasets.

We explore how these models differ in expressivity and how they recognize formal languages. Pushdown Automaton (PDA): A PDA is a computational model capable of recognizing context-free languages using a stack as auxiliary memory. Formally, a PDA is defined as:\nwhere Q represents states, \u03a3 the input alphabet, \u0393 the stack alphabet, and \u03b4 the transition function. The PDA reads an input string x \u2208\u03a3\u2217, updates its stack and states according to \u03b4, and either accepts or rejects x based on the final state and stack configuration. Stack-Augmented Recurrent Neural Network (RNN with Memory): To extend RNNs\u2019 expressivity to context-free languages, they can be augmented with a stack. A stack-augmented RNN is defined as: f = (\u03b8, \u03b8),\nwhere \u03b8c governs the RNN controller, and \u03b8m controls stack operations (push, pop, no-op). At each time step, the model: 1. Updates the hidden state: ht = f(Whht\u22121 + Wxxt + b). 2. Chooses a stack operation: Stackt+1 = \u03b4s(ht, Stackt), where \u03b4s is a learned function. 3. Produces the output based on both the hidden state and stack:\nComparison of Expressivity: While a PDA directly handles context-free languages using a stack, a stack augmented RNN approximates this behavior through learned stack operations. The primary challenge lies in maintaining stability and generalization as sequence complexity increases, particularly for long or deeply nested structures.\n# Methodology\nis section, we first formally define the stability condition of memory less model, where stability is defined as ws nition 0.1 (Stability). Let L be a formal language accepted by a discrete state machine M, such as a finite auton. A sequence model f is said to be stable with respect to L if, for any input sequence x = (x1, x2, . . . , xT ) bitrary length T \u2208N: \u2022 There exists a mapping \u03d5 : States(M) \u2192States(f) such that the state transitions of f are functionally equivalent to those of M. Formally, for each state q \u2208States(M) and corresponding state \u03d5(q) \u2208States(f): \u03b4M(q, xi) = q\u2032 \u21d0\u21d2\u03b4f(\u03d5(q), xi) = \u03d5(q\u2032), where \u03b4M and \u03b4f denote the transition functions for M and f, respectively, and xi is an input symbol. \u2022 The acceptance condition for L is preserved by f. That is, for any sequence x \u2208\u03a3\u2217: x \u2208L \u21d0\u21d2f(x) = 1, where \u03a3 is the input alphabet, and f(x) = 1 indicates acceptance by the model f. \u2022 The behavior of f remains consistent for sequences of arbitrary length. For any two sequences x(1) and x(2) of lengths T1 and T2, respectively, with T1 \u0338= T2: M(x(1)) = f(x(1)) and M(x(2)) = f(x(2)), where M(x) and f(x) denote the outputs of the discrete state machine and the model, respectively. \u2022 Stability is maintained as T \u2192\u221e, ensuring that f does not exhibit performance degradation or erratic behavior for long sequences. sence, a model f is stable if it is functionally equivalent to the discrete state machine M that defines the uage L, preserving both the state transitions and acceptance conditions across sequences of arbitrary length. larly stability of memory augmented RNN is formally defined as follows: nition 0.2 (Stability of a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) Model). Let L be a formal language accepted by a down Automaton (PDA) M = (Q, \u03a3, \u0393, \u03b4, q0, Z0, F), where: \u2022 Q is the set of states, \u2022 \u03a3 is the input alphabet, \u2022 \u0393 is the stack alphabet,\nwhere M(x) and f(x) denote the outputs of the discrete state machine and the model, respectively. \u2022 Stability is maintained as T \u2192\u221e, ensuring that f does not exhibit performance degradation or errat behavior for long sequences.\n\u2022 Q is the set of states, \u2022 \u03a3 is the input alphabet, \u2022 \u0393 is the stack alphabet, \u2022 \u03b4 : Q \u00d7 (\u03a3 \u222a{\u03f5}) \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192Q \u00d7 \u0393\u2217is the transition function,\n\u2022 Q is the set of states, \u2022 \u03a3 is the input alphabet, \u2022 \u0393 is the stack alphabet, \u2022 \u03b4 : Q \u00d7 (\u03a3 \u222a{\u03f5}) \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192Q \u00d7 \u0393\u2217is the transition function,\n\u2022 q0 \u2208Q is the initial state, \u2022 Z0 \u2208\u0393 is the initial stack symbol, \u2022 F \u2286Q is the set of accepting states. uence model f is said to be stable with respect to L if, for any input sequence x = (x1, x2, . . . , xT ) of ry length T \u2208N: \u2022 State Stability: There exists a mapping \u03d5 : Q \u2192States(f) such that the state transitions of f are functionally equivalent to those of the PDA M. Formally, for each state q \u2208Q and corresponding state \u03d5(q) \u2208States(f): \u03b4(q, xi, \u03b3) = (q\u2032, \u03b3\u2032) \u21d0\u21d2\u03b4f(\u03d5(q), xi, \u03b3) = (\u03d5(q\u2032), \u03b3\u2032), where \u03b3 \u2208\u0393 is the top symbol on the stack and \u03b4f represents the transition function of the model f. \u2022 Stack Stability: For the stack operations in f to be stable, the stack manipulation should be equivalent to that of the PDA M. Let StackM(t) and Stackf(t) represent the stack contents at time t for M and f, respectively. The model f is stable if: StackM(t) = Stackf(t) for all t. This ensures that push and pop operations are executed consistently and that the stack remains in sync with the PDA for arbitrary input sequences. \u2022 Acceptance Condition: The model f correctly accepts or rejects sequences according to L. That is, for any sequence x \u2208\u03a3\u2217: x \u2208L \u21d0\u21d2f(x) = 1, where f(x) = 1 indicates acceptance by the model f. \u2022 Behavioral Consistency Across Sequence Lengths: For any two sequences x(1) and x(2) of lengths T1 and T2, respectively, with T1 \u0338= T2: M(x(1)) = f(x(1)) and M(x(2)) = f(x(2)), where M(x) and f(x) denote the outputs of the PDA and the model, respectively. \u2022 Long-Term Stability: The model f remains stable for arbitrarily long sequences, ensuring that its behavior and stack operations do not degrade or become inconsistent as T \u2192\u221e. mary, a model f is stable if it is functionally equivalent to the PDA M that defines the language L, preserving he state transitions and stack operations across sequences of arbitrary length.\n# \u2022 Behavioral Consistency Across Sequence Lengths: For any two sequences x(1) and x(2) of lengths T1 and T2, respectively, with T1 \u0338= T2:\n  M(x(1)) = f(x(1)) and M(x(2)) = f(x(2)),\nwhere M(x) and f(x) denote the outputs of the PDA and the model, respectively. \u2022 Long-Term Stability: The model f remains stable for arbitrarily long sequences, ensu ior and stack operations do not degrade or become inconsistent as T \u2192\u221e.\nwhere M(x) and f(x) denote the outputs of the PDA and the model, respectively.\nwhere M(x) and f(x) denote the outputs of the PDA and the model, respectively. \u2022 Long-Term Stability: The model f remains stable for arbitrarily long sequences, ensuring that its behavior and stack operations do not degrade or become inconsistent as T \u2192\u221e.\n\u2022 Long-Term Stability: The model f remains stable for arbitrarily long sequences, ensuring that its behav ior and stack operations do not degrade or become inconsistent as T \u2192\u221e.\nIn summary, a model f is stable if it is functionally equivalent to the PDA M that defines the language L, preserving both the state transitions and stack operations across sequences of arbitrary length.\n# heoretical Analysis of Stability of Memory Augmented Neural Netwo\nIn this section, we describe the analytical approach used to understand the behavior of stack-augmented Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) when processing formal languages.

Our analysis is structured around a series of theorems that establish key properties such as error growth, stability, and the comparative performance of different configurations of stack-augmented RNNs. First, we formalize the relationship between stability and model performance by evaluating the impact of stack operations and state transitions. Stability is crucial for ensuring consistent performance across sequences of varying lengths, and the presented theorems highlight how instability leads to unbounded error growth, ultimately converging to random guessing or worse. Formally we can show the existence of stable memory augmented RNN as follows: Theorem 0.3 (Stability of Stack-Augmented RNNs). Let L be a formal language recognized by a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) M = (Q, \u03a3, \u0393, \u03b4, q0, Z0, F). Consider a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) f augmented with a stack that models the PDA M. The RNN f is said to be stable if it satisfies the following conditions: 1. The state transitions of f are functionally equivalent to those of the PDA M. 2. The stack operations of f (push, pop, no-op) are consistent with those of M. 3. The outputs of f and M are equivalent for sequences of different lengths.\nFirst, we formalize the relationship between stability and model performance by evaluating the impact of stack operations and state transitions. Stability is crucial for ensuring consistent performance across sequences of varying lengths, and the presented theorems highlight how instability leads to unbounded error growth, ultimately converging to random guessing or worse. Formally we can show the existence of stable memory augmented RNN as follows:\nProof. 1. Let \u03d5 : Q \u2192States(f) be a mapping between the states of the PDA M and the states of the RNN f. Th state transition function of M is defined as:\nwhere \u03a3 is the input alphabet, \u0393 is the stack alphabet, and \u03b4 is the transition function of M. The transition functio of f, denoted as \u03b4f, should satisfy:\nIf this condition holds, then the push, pop, and no-op operations of f are consistent with those of M. Inconsisten stack behavior leads to errors in sequence recognition, causing instability. 3. Consider two input sequences x(1) and x(2) with lengths T1 \u0338= T2. Stability requires that the outputs of f and M are functionally equivalent:\nThis behavioral consistency across sequence lengths follows from stable state transitions and stack operations, ensuring that f correctly processes sequences of varying lengths. If f exhibits degradation in performance for longer sequences, the model is unstable. 4. As sequence length T \u2192\u221e, stability requires:\nwhere Error(f, M) measures the divergence between the outputs of f and M. If this condition holds, the longterm stability of f is guaranteed. Any error accumulation as T increases would indicate instability in either state transitions or stack operations, leading to performance degradation. Thus the RNN f is stable if all four conditions are met. If any of these conditions fail, the model becomes unstable, resulting in incorrect behavior or output divergence from the PDA M. Next, we formally prove that unstable memory-augmented RNN, after arbitrary steps, will eventually become equivalent to a random network, hampering its generalization. Formally we prove following theorem Theorem 0.4. Let L be a formal language recognized by a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) M = (Q, \u03a3, \u0393, \u03b4, q0, Z0, F). Consider a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) f\u03b8 augmented with a stack and parameterized by \u03b8. Let frandom be a randomly initialized network with parameters \u03b8random. If the RNN f\u03b8 is unstable, then the expected loss of f\u03b8 is equivalent to the expected loss of frandom, i.e.,\nwhere Error(f, M) measures the divergence between the outputs of f and M. If this condition holds, the longterm stability of f is guaranteed. Any error accumulation as T increases would indicate instability in either state transitions or stack operations, leading to performance degradation. Thus the RNN f is stable if all four conditions are met. If any of these conditions fail, the model becomes unstable, resulting in incorrect behavior or output divergence from the PDA M.\nwhere Error(f, M) measures the divergence between the outputs of f and M.

Formally we prove following theorem Theorem 0.4. Let L be a formal language recognized by a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) M = (Q, \u03a3, \u0393, \u03b4, q0, Z0, F). Consider a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) f\u03b8 augmented with a stack and parame terized by \u03b8. Let frandom be a randomly initialized network with parameters \u03b8random. If the RNN f\u03b8 is unstable, then the expected loss of f\u03b8 is equivalent to the expected loss of frandom, i.e.,\nE [Loss(f\u03b8(x), y)] \u2248E [Loss(frandom(x), y)] ,\nwhere x is the input, y is the target output, and Loss(\u00b7, \u00b7) is a suitable loss function. Proof. Let M(x) represent the correct output for input x according to the PDA M, and let f\u03b8(x) represent th output of the RNN f\u03b8 for the same input. 1. Instability and Divergence from True Dynamics:\nProof. Let M(x) represent the correct output for input x according to the PDA M, and let f\u03b8(x) represent the output of the RNN f\u03b8 for the same input. 1. Instability and Divergence from True Dynamics:\nle,\nM\nFor an unstable RNN f\u03b8, instability implies that the state transitions and stack operations diverge from those of the PDA M. Specifically, for sufficiently large input sequences x with length T, the output of f\u03b8(x) diverges from the correct output M(x):\nlim T \u2192\u221e|f\u03b8(x) \u2212M(x)| \u2192\u221e.\nThe divergence grows as the sequence length increases, leading to increasingly erroneous outputs. In such cases, f\u03b8 fails to learn the correct language L and instead exhibits behavior that is statistically uncorrelated with M(x). 2. Equivalence to Random Network Behavior: For a randomly initialized network frandom, the output behavior is not correlated with the target output M(x). The expected loss for a random network is:\nThe divergence grows as the sequence length increases, leading to increasingly erroneous outputs. In such cases, f\u03b8 fails to learn the correct language L and instead exhibits behavior that is statistically uncorrelated with M(x). 2. Equivalence to Random Network Behavior:\nE [Loss(frandom(x), y)] = \ufffd x\u2208\u03a3\u2217Loss(frandom(x), y)P(x) dx \u2248Constant.\nwhere P(x) is the distribution over the input space \u03a3\u2217. Since the unstable network f\u03b8 also diverges from the correct output, its performance becomes uncorrelated with the target output y, resulting in an expected loss similar to that of a random network: E [Loss(f\u03b8(x), y)] \u2248Constant.\n# 3. Convergence of Expected Losses:\nAs the instability of f\u03b8 increases, the distribution of its output becomes increasingly similar to that of frandom. In the limit, the expected loss of f\u03b8 approaches the expected loss of frandom:\n# As the instability of f\u03b8 increases, the distribution of its output becomes increasingly similar to that of frandom. In the limit, the expected loss of f\u03b8 approaches the expected loss of frandom:\nlim instability\u2192\u221eE [Loss(f\u03b8(x), y)] = E [Loss(frandom(x), y)] .\nThis indicates that the unstable network is no more learnable than a random network.\nThus the unstable RNN f\u03b8 behaves like a random network in terms of expected loss, it lacks the capacity to learn he correct language L. Thus, the learnability of the unstable system is equivalent to that of a random network.\nNext, we provide error bounds for fully-trained, partially-trained, and frozen networks, which is crucial to derive learnability error bounds in practice, as ideally, the error for the stable system should be much lower compared to these variants. Formally, we show Theorem 0.5 (Learnability of Gradient-Descent Trained Systems). Let L be a formal language recognized by a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) M = (Q, \u03a3, \u0393, \u03b4, q0, Z0, F). Consider a stack-augmented Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) f\u03b8 parameterized by \u03b8 = (\u03b8c, \u03b8m), where \u03b8c represents the parameters of the RNN/controller and \u03b8m represents the parameters governing the stack/memory operations. Define the following configurations: \u2022 f full \u03b8 : Both controller \u03b8c and memory \u03b8m are trainable. \u2022 f frozen \u03b8c : The controller \u03b8c is frozen, and only the memory \u03b8m is trainable. \u2022 f frozen \u03b8m : The memory \u03b8m is frozen, and only the controller \u03b8c is trainable. \u2022 f frozen \u03b8 : Both the controller \u03b8c and the memory \u03b8m are frozen (i.e., the system is untrained or random). Let the loss function be Loss(f\u03b8(x), y), where x \u2208\u03a3\u2217is an input sequence, and y is the target output. The following conditions hold: 1. Stable System Minimizes Error:\n2.

Next we show that Unstable System\u2019s Error is Similar to Untrained System:\nIf the system is unstable, it fails to correctly model the state transitions and stack operations. Let the target output be M(x), where M represents the PDA. For an unstable system, the output diverges from M(x) as the sequence length T increases: lim T \u2192\u221e|f\u03b8(x) \u2212M(x)| \u2192\u221e. Consequently, the system behaves similarly to a random or untrained network, leading to: E \ufffd Loss(f unstable \u03b8 (x), y) \ufffd \u2248E \ufffd Loss(f frozen \u03b8 (x), y) \ufffd .\nthe system is unstable, it fails to correctly model the state transitions and stack operations.

This condition is satisfied because the model correctly captures the underlying dynamics of the PDA, preventing unbounded error growth. 4.

This results in low variance in the error: \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd The low variance implies that the system is robust to changes in sequence length, a key characteristic of stability.\nNext, we explore the conditions under which a frozen RNN with a trainable stack can outperform an unstable fully trained model. This comparison is significant for understanding how different components (controller versus memory) contribute to overall performance, especially when the model faces complex or recursive patterns inherent in context-free languages. The analysis shows that freezing the RNN while allowing the stack to adapt can stabilize performance, leading to more reliable error bounds. Theorem 0.6 (Frozen RNN with Trainable Memory Outperforms an Unstable Fully-Trained Model). Let L be a formal language recognized by a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) M = (Q, \u03a3, \u0393, \u03b4, q0, Z0, F). Consider a stackaugmented Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) f\u03b8 parameterized by \u03b8 = (\u03b8c, \u03b8m), where: \u2022 \u03b8c represents the parameters of the RNN/controller. \u2022 \u03b8m represents the parameters governing the stack operations (memory). Define the following configurations: 1. f frozen \u03b8c : The RNN/controller \u03b8c is frozen, and only the memory \u03b8m is trainable. 2. f unstable \u03b8 : Both \u03b8c and \u03b8m are trainable, but the model is unstable. 3. f frozen \u03b8 : Both the RNN/controller \u03b8c and memory \u03b8m are frozen (i.e., the system is untrained or random). Let the loss function be Loss(f\u03b8(x), y) for input sequence x \u2208\u03a3\u2217and target y. The following results hold: 1. Partially Frozen Model Can Outperform an Unstable Model: There exists a range T \u2208[Tlow, Thigh] such that: E \ufffd Loss(f frozen \u03b8c (x), y) \ufffd < E \ufffd Loss(f unstable \u03b8 (x), y) \ufffd , for x where |x| \u2208[Tlow, Thigh]. 2. Error Growth Bound for Unstable Models: For the fully trained unstable model, the error can exhibit super-linear growth, which can be bounded as: Loss(f unstable \u03b8 (x), y) \u2264a \u00b7 |x|b + c,\nmemory) contribute to overall performance, especially when the model faces complex or recursive patterns inheren in context-free languages. The analysis shows that freezing the RNN while allowing the stack to adapt can stabiliz performance, leading to more reliable error bounds. Theorem 0.6 (Frozen RNN with Trainable Memory Outperforms an Unstable Fully-Trained Model). Let L b a formal language recognized by a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) M = (Q, \u03a3, \u0393, \u03b4, q0, Z0, F). Consider a stack augmented Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) f\u03b8 parameterized by \u03b8 = (\u03b8c, \u03b8m), where: \u2022 \u03b8c represents the parameters of the RNN/controller. \u2022 \u03b8m represents the parameters governing the stack operations (memory). Define the following configurations: 1. f frozen \u03b8c : The RNN/controller \u03b8c is frozen, and only the memory \u03b8m is trainable. 2. f unstable \u03b8 : Both \u03b8c and \u03b8m are trainable, but the model is unstable. 3. f frozen \u03b8 : Both the RNN/controller \u03b8c and memory \u03b8m are frozen (i.e., the system is untrained or random). Let the loss function be Loss(f\u03b8(x), y) for input sequence x \u2208\u03a3\u2217and target y. The following results hold: 1.

Error Growth Bound for Unstable Models: For the fully trained unstable model, the error can exhibit super-linear growth, which can be bounded as: Loss(f unstable (x), y) \u2264a \u00b7 |x|b + c,\nwhere b > 1 indicates super-linear growth, and a, c > 0 are constants dependent on the degree of instability. 3. Performance Bound for Partially Frozen Model: The error for a frozen RNN with trainable memory is bounded by: Loss(f frozen \u03b8c (x), y) \u2264a\u2032 \u00b7 |x| + c\u2032,\nLoss(f frozen \u03b8c (x), y) \u2264a\u2032 \u00b7 |x| + c\u2032,\nwhere a\u2032, c\u2032 > 0 are constants, and a\u2032 is typically smaller than the corresponding constant a for the unstable model. This linear growth ensures better performance for a stable stack-augmented model even if the controller is frozen.\n\nWe provide detailed proof in appendix and prove each conditions highlighted above. We then examine error bounds in unstable models, demonstrating how these models might initially perform well on slightly longer sequences but eventually deteriorate as sequence length increases. This degradation is particularly relevant when assessing models designed to recognize languages with nested structures. The theorems characterize the error growth in unstable systems, providing insight into the rapid error accumulation and eventual convergence to random guessing. Theorem 0.7 (Error Bounds of an Unstable System). Let f\u03b8 be a stack-augmented Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) parameterized by \u03b8 = (\u03b8c, \u03b8m), where: \u2022 \u03b8c represents the parameters of the RNN/controller, \u2022 \u03b8m represents the parameters governing the stack operations (memory). The system is considered unstable if it fails to maintain consistent performance as sequence length increases. Let the loss function be Loss(f\u03b8(x), y) for input sequence x \u2208\u03a3\u2217and target y. Then the following results hold: 1. Initial Performance on Slightly Longer Sequences: There exists a range of sequence lengths |x| \u2208[Ttrain, Ttrain + \u2206T], where \u2206T is small, such that the model may exhibit near-perfect performance (e.g., low error): Loss(f\u03b8(x), y) \u22480 for |x| \u2208[Ttrain, Ttrain + \u2206T]. 2. Error Growth Beyond the Initial Range: As the sequence length continues to increase beyond Ttrain + \u2206T, the error grows rapidly, leading to: Loss(f\u03b8(x), y) \u2264a \u00b7 |x|b + c for |x| > Ttrain + \u2206T, where a > 0, b > 1, and c > 0 indicate super-linear error growth. 3. Convergence to Random Guessing or Worse: As sequence length |x| continues to grow, the model\u2019s performance deteriorates further, ultimately converging to random guessing. The expected loss can be bounded as: lim |x|\u2192\u221eLoss(f\u03b8(x), y) \u2265Lossrandom = 1 k , where k is the number of classes. In some cases, the error may exceed this bound due to the instability: lim |x|\u2192\u221eLoss(f\u03b8(x), y) \u22651 k + \u03f5 for some small \u03f5 > 0. The detailed proof is in the appendix. In the next section, we conduct a series of experiments showing that our methodology connects these theoretical results to practical considerations.\nThe detailed proof is in the appendix. In the next section, we conduct a series of experiments showing that our methodology connects these theoretical results to practical considerations.\n# Experimental Setup\nWe evaluate various RNN architectures on non-context-free languages (non-CFLs) and natural language modeling tasks. For the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset, we test five models: a standard LSTM [1], two stack-augmented RNNs [7], and two nondeterministic stack-augmented RNNs [12] (see appendix for details). For non-CFL tasks, we also evaluate one LSTM [1], three stack-augmented RNNs [7], and one nondeterministic stack-augmented RNN [12]. Non-Context-Free Languages We investigate how stack-augmented RNNs handle non-CFL phenomena by evaluating them on several complex language modeling tasks. Each of the non-CFLs in our study can be recognized by a real-time three-stack automaton. We examine the following seven tasks: 1. Count-3: The language anbncn | n \u22650, which involves counting, reversing, and copying strings with markers. 2.

As shown in Table 1 and 2, both fully trained models and those with only memory trained perform comparably on short sequences. However, when tested on longer sequences (bin2), most models converge to random guessing, underscoring the instability introduced by increased sequence complexity. For instance, in the count-3 task, fully trained models experience a significant accuracy drop\u2014from 98% to 99% down to 75% to 85%. In contrast, freezing the controller during training allows models like LSTM and jm-hidden to maintain around 96% accuracy, while fixing both the controller and memory enables four out of five models to preserve their initial performance. This demonstrates that excessive parameter tuning can destabilize learning rather than enhance it. A similar trend is observed in the count-and-copy task, where models with fixed components maintain stable accuracy near their initial 64%, while fully trained models suffer a drop from 73% to 81% down to 55% to 61%. The PTB dataset also shows that models with only memory trained outperform fully trained counterparts, reinforcing that over-parameterization during training introduces noise and instability (Table 3). These results highlight that stability is essential for effective learning. Models exhibiting stable performance across varying sequence lengths are more likely to generalize well, while instability often leads to poor long-term retention and performance degradation. Additional analysis are shown in appendix.\n# Conclusion.\nOur theoretical analysis demonstrates that unstable systems tend to converge to random guessing, or even worse, under certain conditions. We validated these findings through a series of experiments that consistently showed this behavior in practice. These results highlight that understanding stability and rigorously testing models on longer sequences are crucial for achieving better learnability. In scenarios where longer sequences are not available, the error bounds of the system ideally should be better than random guessing or models with partially frozen parameters. Our study emphasizes that selectively freezing components during training can lead to more stable behavior and improved generalization, especially for longer sequences but is still farway compared to stable models. Thus evaluating stability across varying sequence lengths provides key insights into a model\u2019s ability to maintain robust performance, making stability assessments a critical factor in building more reliable and learnable sequence models.\n# References\n[1] F.

While these architectures perform well on simple languages, such as basic counting tasks and Dyck languages [13, 14, 15], they struggle with more complex languages, especially when generalizing to longer sequences [16]. The lack of external memory structures limits these models\u2019 ability to handle advanced languages, confining their generalization to sequence lengths close to those seen during training [17, 18]. While some recent work has explored length generalization in synthetic reasoning tasks with large pretrained models [19, 20], these studies are often disconnected from the more rigorous demands of formal language learning. On other hand several studies have shown that the choice of objective functions [21] and learning algorithms [22] significantly affects RNNs\u2019 ability to stably learn complex grammars. For instance, [21] demonstrated that specialized loss functions, such as minimum description length, lead to more stable convergence and better generalization on formal language tasks. Although RNNs are theoretically Turing complete, practical constraints such as finite precision and limited recurrent steps diminish their real-world expressivity [23, 24]. Under such constraints, standard RNNs and GRUs are restricted to regular languages, while LSTMs can approximate context-free languages by simulating k-counter mechanisms [25, 26, 2]. Tensor RNNs [3, 27] have extended these capabilities, but their higher computational costs make them challenging to deploy. Memory-augmented architectures have been proposed to overcome these limitations by integrating external structures such as stacks [5, 7, 8], random access memory [28, 29], and memory matrices [30, 6]. These models have shown success in recognizing more complex languages and executing tasks like string copying and reversal. However, most research has focused on theoretical expressivity and evaluations on short sequences. Consequently, many studies fail to test these models on longer sequences, where stability issues become more apparent [20]. Empirical studies have begun to emphasize the need for testing on longer sequences [4, 10, 27], and recent theoretical work by Stogin [5] has identified stable differentiable memory structures. Yet, these insights are not comprehensive and lack a systematic analysis of stability. The primary gap in existing research is the absence of focused investigations into the stability of memoryaugmented models, particularly when processing sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Stability, in this context, refers to a model\u2019s ability to maintain consistent performance across varying sequence lengths without degradation in accuracy or memory manipulation. Most studies evaluate models on sequences similar in length to the training data, thereby overlooking the challenges posed by longer inputs. As a result, while these models often achieve high accuracy within the training range, they frequently exhibit instability when exposed to longer sequences. This study addresses these gaps by examining the stability of stack-augmented RNNs across varying sequence lengths. We explore how different configurations, such as freezing the RNN controller while keeping the memory trainable, impact stability. We derive theoretical conditions for stable performance and identify when models become unstable. Our work is among the first to systematically investigate the stability of memory-augmented neural networks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, providing insights into factors that influence learnability and generalization across longer and more complex sequences.\n# Appendix B: Additional Results\nFigure 1-3 and Table 4-7 provide comprehensive overview of our hypothesis. In our experiments with the noncontext-free language task count-3, a notable divergence in performance emerged between fully trained models and those with selective components frozen. During evaluation on sequences within the training range (40 to 100 tokens), all models performed comparably. However, as sequence lengths extended beyond this range (100-200 and 200-400 tokens), fully trained models exhibited significant performance degradation, with accuracy decreasing to between 75% and 85%. This decline illustrates the difficulty these models face in generalizing to longer sequences, where learned dependencies may not scale effectively.\nConversely, models with a frozen controller demonstrated remarkable stability, maintaining near-perfect accuracy (up to 99%) even on the longest test sequences. This suggests that freezing the controller helps mitigate instability introduced by continuous parameter updates, thereby improving the model\u2019s ability to generalize over extended input lengths. Further analysis of the model jm-hidden, which leverages a superposition stack RNN and offloads the controller\u2019s hidden state to external memory, reinforces these observations. When fully trained (jm-hidden none), the model\u2019s predictions begin to diverge from the expected outputs as sequence lengths increase, particularly beyond 200 tokens, highlighting instability in handling extended input sequences. However, when the memory component is frozen (jm-hidden m), the model exhibits stable performance, closely aligning with the expected outputs across all tested sequence lengths, including the longest sequences. This stability trend was consistently observed in our experiments on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset for language modeling. Models such as jm-hidden-247, jm-learned-22, and rns-4-5 with frozen memory components not only retained performance but, in some cases, outperformed their fully trained counterparts, achieving superior perplexity scores (126.8 \u2192125.1, 125.9 \u2192124.2, 126.5 \u2192120.5, respectively). These results underscore the critical role of stability in enhancing the generalization capabilities of neural architectures, particularly in tasks involving long sequences. Freezing specific components, such as memory or the controller, leads to more reliable and robust performance, highlighting the necessity of incorporating stability considerations into neural network design.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/69ae/69ae5fe4-286c-490f-957f-f36771969c8f.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\nFigure 1: Performance of various models using 4 configuration (none = fully trained model, m = only memory is trained, c = only controller is trained and cm = controller and memory are frozen and only classifier is trainable.

Ideally, the model should satisfy:\nLoss(f\u03b8(xlong), ylong) \u2248Loss(f\u03b8(xshort), yshort).\nTesting on sequences 2-4 times longer than those seen during training helps reveal whether the system can generalize to more complex scenarios without significant error growth.\n# Generalization to Unseen Sequence Patterns\nThe system should generalize to novel input sequences that conform to the language L but are not explicitly encountered during training. The criterion is that the model\u2019s error on unseen patterns should be similar to that on known patterns:\n|Loss(f\u03b8(xnew), ynew) \u2212Loss(f\u03b8(xknown), yknown)| \u2264\u03b4,\nTask\nModel\nMetrics\nVal PPL\nBin0 PPL\nBin1 PPL\nBin2 PPL\nBin0 Acc\nBin1 Acc\nBin2 Acc\ncount-3\nlstm\n1.04\n1.05\n1.28\n1.88\n0.99\n0.90\n0.75\njm-10\n1.04\n1.05\n1.21\n1.70\n0.98\n0.86\n0.76\njm-3.3.3\n1.04\n1.06\n1.25\n1.69\n0.98\n0.92\n0.78\njm-hidden\n1.04\n1.05\n1.19\n1.70\n0.99\n0.99\n0.97\nrns-3-3\n1.04\n1.05\n1.36\n2.87\n0.98\n0.85\n0.72\nmarked-reverse-and-copy\nlstm\n1.38\n1.55\n11.64\n3.56\n0.77\n0.48\n0.48\njm-10\n1.38\n1.51\n20.13\n10.30\n0.77\n0.49\n0.47\njm-3.3.3\n1.41\n1.54\n12.47\n11.30\n0.76\n0.49\n0.46\njm-hidden\n1.37\n1.49\n134.47\n13.62\n0.78\n0.56\n0.50\nrns-3-3\n1.36\n1.52\n23.70\n233.30\n0.78\n0.47\n0.41\ncount-and-copy\nlstm\n1.43\n1.50\n1.93\n16.86\n0.76\n0.63\n0.54\njm-10\n1.45\n1.53\n2.01\n2.39\n0.76\n0.64\n0.56\njm-3.3.3\n1.49\n1.56\n2.41\n1266.62\n0.73\n0.60\n0.53\njm-hidden\n1.40\n1.57\n131.80\n115.32\n0.76\n0.60\n0.54\nrns-3-3\n1.43\n1.58\n16.84\n175.87\n0.74\n0.59\n0.53\nmarked-copy\nlstm\n1.65\n1.77\n2.73\n10.88\n0.67\n0.49\n0.42\njm-10\n1.75\n1.81\n2.32\n2.92\n0.63\n0.50\n0.36\njm-3.3.3\n1.76\n1.85\n2.28\n2.26\n0.62\n0.49\n0.50\njm-hidden\n1.63\n1.89\n159.06\n103370.22\n0.63\n0.47\n0.50\nrns-3-3\n1.79\n2.02\n18.16\n2.82\n0.57\n0.38\n0.32\nunmarked-copy-diff-alpha\nlstm\n1.62\n1.69\n2.26\n1103.65\n0.67\n0.54\n0.47\njm-10\n1.59\n1.72\n2.49\n1242.00\n0.68\n0.51\n0.39\njm-3.3.3\n1.63\n1.72\n2.27\n17.13\n0.67\n0.55\n0.46\njm-hidden\n1.60\n1.70\n2.32\n17.39\n0.67\n0.54\n0.51\nrns-3-3\n1.71\n1.82\n13.09\n13.72\n0.65\n0.52\n0.49\nunmarked-reverse-and-copy\nlstm\n1.64\n1.81\n3.12\n10.05\n0.68\n0.54\n0.50\njm-10\n1.68\n1.86\n3.02\n10.41\n0.66\n0.54\n0.50\njm-3.3.3\n1.68\n1.87\n3.21\n11.97\n0.67\n0.53\n0.50\njm-hidden\n1.65\n1.83\n3.45\n14.59\n0.67\n0.53\n0.50\nrns-3-3\n1.61\n1.82\n3.29\n11.07\n0.69\n0.56\n0.51\nunmarked-copy\nlstm\n1.85\n1.93\n2.19\n2.23\n0.60\n0.54\n0.51\njm-10\n1.82\n1.92\n2.44\n2.67\n0.61\n0.54\n0.51\njm-3.3.3\n1.84\n1.94\n2.21\n14.98\n0.61\n0.53\n0.50\njm-hidden\n1.81\n1.90\n2.68\n10.87\n0.62\n0.54\n0.50\nrns-3-3\n1.85\n1.94\n2.27\n2.38\n0.60\n0.53\n0.50\nTable 6: Performance of different models on context free languages when only parameter belonging to memory\nTable 6: Performance of different models on context free languages when only parameter belonging to memory are trainable (mode = m).
