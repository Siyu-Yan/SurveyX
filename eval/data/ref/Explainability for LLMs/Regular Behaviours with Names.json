Coalgebras for endofunctors on nominal sets model, e.g., various forms of automata with names as well as infinite terms with variable binding operators (such as \u03bb-abstraction).

They are sets equipped with an action of the group of finite permutations on a given fixed set V of atoms (playing the roles of names or variables in applications). Gabbay and Pitts [12 coined the term nominal sets for such sets, and use them as a convenient framework for dealing with binding operators, name abstraction and structural induction.

For example, in order to deal with variable binding in the \u03bb-calculus one considers the functor\n# L\u03b1X = V + [V]X + X \u00d7 X\non Nom, the category of nominal sets, expressing the type of term constructors (note that the abstraction functor [V]X is a quotient of V \u00d7 X modulo renaming \u201cbound\u201d variables). Gabbay and Pitts proved that the initial algebra for L\u03b1 is formed by all \u03bb-terms modulo \u03b1-equivalence. This implies that in lieu of having to deal syntactically with the subtle issues arising in the presence of free and bound variables in inductive definitions on terms, one can simply use initiality as a definition principle. Recently, Kurz et al. [22] have characterized the final coalgebra for L\u03b1 (and more generally, for functors arising from so-called binding signatures): it is carried by the set of all infinitary \u03bb-terms (i.e. finite or infinite \u03bb-trees) with finitely many free variables modulo \u03b1-equivalence. This then allows defining operations on infinitary \u03bb-terms by coinduction, for example substitution and operations that assign to an infinitary \u03bb-term its normal form computations (e.g. the B\u00a8ohm, LevyLongo, and Berarducci trees of a given infinitary \u03bb-term). But while the final coalgebra of a functor F collects the behaviour of all coalgebras, one is often interested only in behaviours of coalgebras whose carrier admits a finite representation; in the case of nominal sets this means that the carrier is orbit-finite. In general, for a finitary endofunctor F on a locally finitely presentable category, the behaviour of F-coalgebras with a finitely presentable carrier is captured by the notion of rational fixpoint for F (see [4,26]). This fixpoint lies between the initial algebra and the final coalgebra for F; as a coalgebra, it is characterized as the final locally finitely presentable coalgebra1. Examples of rational fixpoints include the sets of regular languages, of eventually periodic and rational streams, respectively, and of rational formal power-series. For a polynomial endofunctor F\u03a3 on sets associated to the signature \u03a3, the rational fixpoint consists of Elgot\u2019s regular \u03a3-trees [10], i.e. those (finite and infinite) \u03a3-trees that have only finitely many different subtrees (up to isomorphism). Recently, Milius and Wi\u00dfmann [27] gave a description of the rational fixpoint of L\u03b1 on Nom; it is formed by all rational \u03bb-trees modulo \u03b1-equivalence. In this paper we extend the latter result to a description of the rational fixpoint for an axiomatically defined class of functors. This class (properly) includes all binding functors, i.e. functors arising from binding signatures, but also the finite power-set functor and exponentiation by orbit-finite strong nominal sets, and our class is closed under coproducts, finite products, composition and quotients of functors. Unsurprisingly, in the special case of a functor for a binding signature, the rational fixpoint is formed by the rational trees over the given binding signature modulo \u03b1-equivalence. However, the proof of our more general result is surprisingly non-trivial, and not related to the one given in [27] for the special case L\u03b1. Instead we take a fresh approach and first consider endofunctors \u00afF on Nom that are a\n1 A coalgebra is locally finitely presentable (lfp) if every state in it generates a finitely presentable subcoalgebra. We are aware of the terminological clash with locally finitely presentable categories but it seems contrived to call coalgebras with the mentioned property by any other name.\n1 A coalgebra is locally finitely presentable (lfp) if every state in it generates a finitely presentable subcoalgebra.

In general, it is easy to see that for such functors \u00afF the initial algebra is a lifting of the inital F-algebra. However, the final coalgebra does not lift in general; for example, for the Nom-functor LX = V + V \u00d7 X + X \u00d7 X, the final coalgebra of the underlying Set-functor consists of all \u03bb-trees, and the final L-coalgebra in Nom consists of all \u03bb-trees with finitely many variables. The rational fixpoint of L, on the other hand, does, by our results, lift from Set to Nom; however, this does not hold for arbitrary liftings of finitary functors. We introduce the notion of a localizable lifting (Definition 3.12) and we prove that the rational fixpoint of a localizable lifting \u00afF on Nom is a lifting of the rational fixpoint of F on sets (Theorem 4.14). In order to characterize the rational fixpoint of functors that make use of the nominal structure, like L\u03b1, we then turn our attention to quotients of a functor G on Nom. In fact, we introduce the notion of a sub-strength (Definition 5.4) of an endofunctor on Nom, and we prove that whenever G is equipped with a substrength then the rational fixpoint of any quotient of G is a canonical quotient coalgebra of the rational fixpoint of G (Corollary 5.14). We will then see that the combination of Theorem 4.14 and Corollary 5.14 allows us to obtain the desired description of the rational fixpoint of a functor arising from a binding signature in combination with exponentiation by an orbitfinite strong nominal set. As a special case we obtain that \u033aL\u03b1 is formed by those \u03b1-equivalence classes of \u03bb-trees which contain at least one rational \u03bb-tree. The fact that our results cover exponentiation, which occurs prominently in functors for various automata models, is based on a construction that identifies exponentiation by an orbit-finite strong exponent as a quotient of a polynomial functor.\nWe summarize the requisite background on permutations, nominal sets, and rational fixpoints of functors. We assume that readers are familiar with basic notions of category theory and with algebras and coalgebras for an endofunctor, but start with a terse review of the latter. Recall that a coalgebra for an endofunctor F : C \u2192C is a pair (C, c) consisting of an object C of C and a morphism c : X \u2192FX called the structure of the coalgebra. A coalgebra homomorphism from (C, c) to (D, d) is a C-morphism f : C \u2192D such that d \u00b7 f = Ff \u00b7 c. A very important concept is that of a final coalgebra, i. e. an F-coalgebra t : \u03bdF \u2192F(\u03bdF) such that for every F-coalgebra (C, c) there exists a unique homomorphism c\u2020 : (C, c) \u2192(\u03bdF, t). Final coalgebras exist under mild assumptions on C and F, e.g. whenever C is locally presentable and F is accessible [25]. Intuitively, an F-coalgebra (C, c) can be thought of as a dynamic system with an object C of states and with observations about the states (e.g. output, next states etc.) given by c. The type of observations that can be made about a dynamic systems is described by the functor F. We denote by Coalg F the category of Fcoalgebras and their homomorphisms. For more intuition and concrete examples we refer the reader to introductory texts on coalgebras [32,16,1].\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/af06/af06ec34-7164-45c6-bd9e-4ac20053aaef.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 1 Diagrammatic illustration of (2.1).

By finiteness of f[W], we then have f\u2212m(v) = v for some m \u22651 and therefore f(v) = f(f\u2212m(v)) \u2208f[W], which implies that v \u2208W, so the first case in (2.1) applies. For injectivity, let f|W (u) = f|W (v) for u, v \u2208V and distinguish the following\n\u2013 For u, v \u2208W, f(u) = f(v) and so u = v as required. \u2013 For u \u2208W, v /\u2208W, we have f(u) = f\u2212n(v) /\u2208f[W], contradiction. \u2013 For u, v /\u2208W, we have f\u2212n(u) = f\u2212m(v), with n, m minimal. \u2013 If n = m, then u = v as required. \u2013 If n \u0338= m, w.l.o.g. n > m, then f(v) = f\u2212(n\u2212m\u22121)(u) \u2208f[W] by minimality of n, since n \u2212m \u22121 \u22650. This implies v \u2208W, contradiction.\nFor surjectivity, let v \u2208X. \u2013 If v \u2208f[W], then f\u22121(v) \u2208W and thus f|W (f\u22121(v)) = v.\n(2.1)\n\u2013 If v /\u2208f[W], then let k \u22650 be minimal such that fk(v) /\u2208W. Such a k exists because W is finite and v \u0338\u2208f[W]. So we have f|W (fk(v)) = f\u2212k(fk(v)) = v because firstly fk(v) \u0338\u2208W, and secondly for all n < k,\nThis shows that f|W is a permutation. To see that f|W is finite, note that f|W (v) = v for v /\u2208W \u222af[W], which is a finite set. Remark 2.4 In summary, we have: 1. f|W [W] = f[W], 2. f|W [f[W]\\W] = W \\f[W], and 3. f|W fixes every element that is not contained in W or f[W]. Moreover, the permutation\nThis shows that f|W is a permutation.

Since f|W \u00b7 g = f, this means that we can factor any permutation f into a finite permutation f|W and a permutation g that fixes W. Remark 2.5 Restriction is compatible with composition in the following sense: for permutations f, h and finite W \u2286X, we have\nmaps any v \u2208W to g(v) = f|\u22121 W (f(v)) = v by (2.1).

Remark 2.5 Restriction is compatible with composition in the following sense: for permutations f, h and finite W \u2286X, we have (f \u00b7 h)|W (v) = f \u00b7 h(v) = f|h[W ] \u00b7 h(v) = f|h[W ] \u00b7 h|W (v) for all v \u2208W using (2.1) multiple times.\n# 2.2 Nominal Sets\nWe now briefly recall the key definitions in the theory of nominal sets; see [30] for a detailed introduction. Recall that given a monoid (or more specifically a group) M, an M-set is a set X equipped with a left action of M, which we denote by mere juxtaposition or by the infix operator \u00b7 . The M-sets are the Eilenberg-Moore algebras of the monad M \u00d7(\u2212) , which has the unit \u03b7(x) = (e, x) and multiplication \u00b5(n, (m, x)) = (nm, x) where e is the unit of M. Given M-sets (X, \u00b7) and (Y, \u2217), a map f : X \u2192Y is equivariant if \u03c0 \u2217f(x) = f(\u03c0 \u00b7x) for all \u03c0 \u2208M, x \u2208X. M-sets and equivariant maps form a category, M-set. We fix a set V of (variable) names (or atoms). As usual, the symmetric group S(V) is the group of all permutations of V; we denote by Sf(V) the subgroup of finite permutations of V, i.e. the subgroup of S(V) generated by the transpositions. We have an obvious left action of Sf(V) on V given by \u03c0\u00b7v = \u03c0(v) for any \u03c0 \u2208Sf(V) and v \u2208V. Given a Sf(V)-set X, we define\nfix(x) = {\u03c0 \u2208Sf(V) | \u03c0 \u00b7 x = x} and Fix(A) = {\u03c0 \u2208Sf(V) | \u03c0 \u00b7 x = x for all x \u2208A} for x \u2208X and A \u2286X. We say that a set A \u2286V is a support of x \u2208X or that A supports x if\ni.e. if any permutation that fixes all names in A also fixes x. Moreover, x \u2208X is finitely supported if there exists a finite set of names that supports x. In this case, it can be shown (see e.g. [30]) that x has a least support, denoted supp(x) and called the support of x. We say that v \u2208V is fresh for x, and write v #x, if v \u2208V \\supp(x).\n\u2293\u2294\nA nominal set is a Sf(V)-set (X, \u00b7) (or just X) such that all elements of X are finitely supported. We denote by Nom the full subcategory of Sf(V)-set spanned by the nominal sets. We have forgetful functors V : Sf(V)-set \u2192Set and U : Nom \u2192 Set. Note that for each nominal set X, the function supp : X \u2192Pf(V) mapping each element to its (finite) support is an equivariant map. Example 2.6 (1) The set V of names with the group action \u03c0 \u00b7 v = \u03c0(v) is a nominal set; for each v \u2208V the singleton {v} supports v. (2) Every ordinary set X can be made into a nominal set DX (D for discrete) by equipping it with the trivial group action (also called the trivial or discrete nominal structure) \u03c0 \u00b7 x = x for all x \u2208X and \u03c0 \u2208Sf(V). So each x \u2208DX has empty support. (3) The finite \u03bb-terms form a nominal set with the group action given by renaming of (free as well as bound!) variables [11]. The support of a \u03bb-term is the set of all variables that occur in it. In contrast, the set of all (potentially infinite) \u03bb-trees is not nominal since \u03bb-trees with infinitely many variables do not have finite support. However, the set of all \u03bb-trees with finitely many variables is nominal. (4) Given a nominal set X, the set Pf(X) of finite subsets of X equipped with the point-wise action of Sf(V) is a nominal set. The support supp(Y ) of Y \u2208Pf(X) is the union \ufffd x\u2208Y supp(x). In particular, the support of each finite W \u2208Pf(V) is W itself. Note that P(V) with the point-wise action is not a nominal set because any subset of V that is neither finite nor cofinite fails to be finitely supported. However, the set Pfs(X) \u2286P(X) of finitely supported subsets of X is a nominal set. Remark 2.7 (1) For an equivariant map f : X \u2192Y between nominal sets, we have supp(f(x)) \u2286supp(x) for any x \u2208X. To see this, let \u03c0 \u2208Fix(supp(x)). Then \u03c0 \u00b7 f(x) = f(\u03c0 \u00b7 x) = f(x), so supp(x) also supports f(x) and thus supp(f(x)) \u2286 supp(x). (2) For \u03c0 \u2208Sf(V) and a Sf(V)-set X we denote by \u03c0X the bijection X \u2192X defined by x \ufffd\u2192\u03c0 \u00b7 x. Note that \u03c0X fails to be equivariant unless X is discrete. However, \u03c0 commutes with all equivariant maps f : X \u2192Y in the sense that f\u03c0X = \u03c0Y f; in other words: \u03c0 : U \u2192U is a natural isomorphism. (3) Every nominal set X can be uniquely extended to a S(V)-set [14]. By the discussion in Section 2.1, the S(V)-action can be defined as \u03c0 \u00b7 x = \u03c0|supp(x) \u00b7 x for \u03c0 \u2208S(V). By the first item, maps f that are equivariant w.r.t. the action of Sf(V) are equivariant also w.r.t. the extended action: For \u03c0 \u2208S(V), we have f(\u03c0 \u00b7 x) = f(\u03c0|supp(x) \u00b7 x) = \u03c0|supp(x) \u00b7 f(x) = \u03c0|supp(f(x)) \u00b7 f(x) = \u03c0 \u00b7 f(x), using in the second-to-last step that \u03c0|supp(x) and \u03c0|supp(f(x)) agree on supp(f(x)). The category of nominal sets is (equivalent to) a Grothendieck topos (the so-called Schanuel topos), and so it has rich categorical structure [14]. In the following we recall the structural properties needed in the current paper. Monomorphisms and epimorphisms in Nom are precisely the injective and surjective equivariant maps, respectively. It is not difficult to see that every epimorphism in Nom is strong, i.e., it has the unique diagonalization property w.r.t. any monomorphism: given an epimorphism e : A \u0589 B, a monomorphism m : C \u0592\u2192D and f : A \u2192C, g : B \u2192D such that g \u00b7 e = m \u00b7 f, there exists a unique diagonal\nThe category of nominal sets is (equivalent to) a Grothendieck topos (the so-called Schanuel topos), and so it has rich categorical structure [14].

For an endofunctor F on Nom preserving monos, this factorization system lifts to Coalg F: every F-coalgebra homomorphism f has a factorization f = m\u00b7e where e and m are F-coalgebra homomorphisms that are epimorphic and monomorphic in Nom, respectively. Being a Grothendieck topos, Nom is complete and cocomplete. Moreover, colimits and finite limits are formed as in Set, and in fact the forgetful functor U : Nom \u2192Set creates all colimits and all finite limits [29]. Furthermore, Nom is a locally finitely presentable category [13,5]. Recall that a locally finitely presentable category is a cocomplete category C having a set A of finitely presentable objects such that every object of C is a filtered colimit of objects from A. Petri\u00b8san [28, Proposition 2.3.7] shows that the finitely presentable objects of Nom are precisely the orbit-finite nominal sets: Definition 2.8 Given a nominal set X and x \u2208X, the set {\u03c0 \u00b7 x | \u03c0 \u2208Sf(V)} is called the orbit of x. A nominal set (X, \u00b7) is said to be orbit-finite if it has only finitely many orbits. The notion of orbit-finiteness plays a central role in our paper since the rational fixpoint of an endofunctor F on Nom can be constructed as the filtered colimit of all F-coalgebras with orbit-finite carrier. We now collect a few easy properties of orbit-finite sets that we are going to need. First of all, orbit-finite sets are closed under finite products and subobjects; hence, under all finite limits (see [30, Chapter 5]). And they are clearly closed under finite coproducts (a well known property of finitely presentable objects) and quotient objects (since the codomain of a surjective equivariant map clearly has fewer orbits); hence under all finite colimits. Generally, for the value of \u03c0 \u00b7 x, it matters only what \u03c0 does on the atoms in supp(x): Lemma 2.9 For x \u2208(X, \u00b7) and any \u03c0, \u03c3 \u2208Sf(V) with \u03c0(v) = \u03c3(v) for all v \u2208supp(x), we have \u03c0 \u00b7 x = \u03c3 \u00b7 x.\nDefinition 2.8 Given a nominal set X and x \u2208X, the set {\u03c0 \u00b7 x | \u03c0 \u2208Sf(V)}  called the orbit of x. A nominal set (X, \u00b7) is said to be orbit-finite if it has onl finitely many orbits.\n# Proof Let \u03c0 \u2208Sf(V) such that supp(x) = supp(\u03c0 \u00b7 x). Then\n\u03c0[supp(x)] = \u03c0 \u00b7 supp(x) = supp(\u03c0 \u00b7 x) = supp(x),\nwhich shows that \u03c0 restricts to a permutation of supp(x). If \u03c3 is also such that supp(x) = supp(\u03c3\u00b7x) and restricts to the same permutation on supp(x) as \u03c0, then \u03c0\u00b7x = \u03c3\u00b7x by Lemma 2.9. Therefore the number of elements in question is at most the number of permutations of supp(x), i.e. at most | supp(x)|!. \u2293\u2294\nOne of the properties that make nominal sets interesting for applications in computer science is that one can think of an element x of a nominal set as an abstract term and of supp(x) as the set of free variables of x. It is then possible to speak about \u03b1-equivalence on a nominal set, and this leads to Gabbay and Pitts\u2019 abstraction functor [12, Lemma 5.1]:\n(v1, x1) \u223c\u03b1 (v2, x2) if (v1 z)x1 = (v2 z)x2 for z # {v1, v2, x1, x2}\nwhere the definition of z # M spelled out for the case of a finite set M means that z is fresh for every element of M. The \u223c\u03b1-equivalence class of (v, x) is denoted by \u27e8v\u27e9x. The abstraction [V]X of X is the quotient (V \u00d7 X)/\u223c\u03b1 with the group action defined by\nFor an equivariant map f : X \u2192Y , [V]f : [V]X \u2192[V]Y is defined by \u27e8v\u27e9x \ufffd\u2192 \u27e8v\u27e9(f(x)).\n2.3 The Rational Fixpoint\nRecall that by Lambek\u2019s Lemma [24], the structure maps of the initial algebra and the final coalgebra for a functor F are isomorphisms, so both yield fixpoints of F. Here we shall be interested in a third fixpoint that lies between the initial algebra and the final coalgebra, the rational fixpoint of F. The rational fixpoint can be characterized either as the initial iterative algebra for F [4] or as the final locally finitely presentable coalgebra for F [26]. We will need only the latter description here. The rational fixpoint can be defined for any finitary endofunctor F on a locally finitely presentable category C, i.e. F is an endofunctor on C that preserves filtered colimits. Examples of locally finitely presentable categories are Set, the categories of posets and of graphs, every finitary variety of algebras (such as groups, rings, and vector spaces) and every Grothendieck topos (such as Nom). The finitely presentable objects in these categories are: all finite sets, posets or graphs, algebras presented by finitely many generators and relations, and, as we mentioned before, the orbit-finite nominal sets. Now let F : C \u2192C be finitary on the locally finitely presentable category C and consider the full subcategory Coalgf F of Coalg F given by all F-coalgebras with finitely presentable carrier. The locally finitely presentable F-coalgebras are\n\u2293\u2294\ncharacterized as precisely those coalgebras that arise as a colimit of a filtered diagram of coalgebras from Coalgf F [26]. It follows that the final locally finitely presentable coalgebra can be constructed as the colimit of all coalgebras from Coalgf F. More precisely, one defines a coalgebra r : \u033aF \u2192F(\u033aF) as the colimit of the inclusion functor of Coalgf F: (\u033aF, r) := colim(Coalgf F \u0592\u2192Coalg F). Note that since the forgetful functor Coalg F \u2192C creates all colimits, this colimit is actually formed on the level of C. The colimit \u033aF then carries a uniquely determined coalgebra structure r making it the colimit above. As shown in [4], \u033aF is a fixpoint for F, i.e. its coalgebra structure r is an isomorphism. From [26] we obtain that local finite presentability of a coalgebra (C, c) has the following concrete characterizations: (1) for C = Set local finiteness, i.e. every element of C is contained in a finite subcoalgebra of C; (2) for C = Nom, local orbit-finiteness, i.e. every element of C is contained in an orbit-finite subcoalgebra of C; (3) for C the category of vector spaces over a field K, local finite dimensionality, i.e., every element of C is contained in a subcoalgebra of C carried by a finite dimensional subspace of C. Example 2.13 We list a few examples of rational fixpoints; for more see [4,26,8]. (1) Consider the functor FX = 2 \u00d7 XA on Set where A is an input alphabet and 2 = {0, 1}. The F-coalgebras are precisely the deterministic automata over A (without initial states). The final coalgebra is carried by the set P(A\u2217) of all formal languages, and the rational fixpoint is its subcoalgebra of regular languages over A. (2) For FX = R \u00d7 X on Set, the final coalgebra is carried by the set R\u03c9 of all real streams, and the rational fixpoint is its subcoalgebra of all eventually periodic streams, i.e. streams uvvv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 with u, v \u2208R\u2217. Taking the same functor on the category of real vector spaces, we obtain the same final coalgebra R\u03c9 with the componentwise vector space structure, but this time the rational fixpoint is formed by all rational streams (see [33,26]). (3) Recall that in general algebra a finitary signature \u03a3 of operation symbols with prescribed arity is a sequence (\u03a3n)n<\u03c9 of sets. This give rise to an associated polynomial endofunctor F\u03a3 on Set given by F\u03a3X = \ufffd n<\u03c9 \u03a3n \u00d7 Xn. Its initial algebra is formed by all \u03a3-terms and its final coalgebra by all (finite and infinite) \u03a3-trees, i.e. rooted and ordered trees such that every node with n children is labelled by an n-ary operation symbol. And the rational fixpoint consists precisely of all rational \u03a3-trees [10,9], i.e. those \u03a3-trees that have only finitely many different subtrees up to isomorphism [15]. (4) For the finite powerset functor Pf, the initial algebra is the \u03c9-th step of the cumulative hierarchy of sets, i.e. \ufffd n<\u03c9 Pf n(\u2205). An isomorphic description is as the set of all finite extensional trees, where a tree is called extensional if distinct children of any vertex define non-isomorphic subtrees. A final Pf-coalgebra is carried by the set of all strongly-extensional finitely branching trees, where a tree t is called strongly-extensional if for any node x of t no two subtrees of t rooted at x are tree-bisimilar; for further explanation and details see [35] or [2, Corollary 3.19]. And the rational fixpoint of Pf is given by all rational strongly-extensional trees. (5) The bag functor B : Set \u2192Set assigns to every set X the set of all finite multisets on X, i.e. the free commutative monoid over X. Here we consider trees where children of a vertex are not ordered (in constrast to \u03a3-trees in\nitem (3)), i.e. the usual graph theoretic notion of tree. Then the initial algebra for B is given by all finite trees, the final coalgebra by all finitely branching ones and the rational fixpoint by all rational ones. This follows from the results in [3]. Note that in all the above examples, the rational fixpoint \u033aF is a subcoalgebra of the final coalgebra \u03bdF. This need not be the case in general (see [8, Example 3.15] for a counterexample). However, we do have the following result: Proposition 2.14 [8, Proposition 3.12] Suppose that in C, finitely presentable objects are closed under strong quotients and that F is finitary and preserves monomorphisms. Then the rational fixpoint \u033aF is the subcoalgebra of \u03bdF given by the union of the images of all coalgebra homomorphisms c\u2020 : (C, c) \u2192(\u03bdF, t) where (C, c) ranges over Coalgf F.2 In particular, for a finitary functor F on Set or Nom, respectively, that preserves monomorphisms, the rational fixpoint is the union of the images in \u03bdF of all finite (or orbit-finite resp.) coalgebras; in symbols:\n# \u033aF = \ufffd (C, c) in Coalgf F c\u2020[C] \u2286\u03bdF.\nNote that it is sufficient to let (C, c) range over those coalgebras in Coalgf F where c\u2020 is injective, because for an arbitrary (orbit-)finite (C, c) in CoalgfF, its image c\u2020[C] is again an (orbit-)finite F-coalgebra, and has an injective structure map.\n# 3 Liftings of Finitary Functors\nWe now direct our attention to liftings of finitary Set-functors, with a view to investigating their rational fixpoints. We fix some terminology:\nWe now direct our attention to liftings of finitary Set-functors, with a view to investigating their rational fixpoints. We fix some terminology: Definition 3.1 A lifting (or, for distinction, a Nom-lifting) of a functor F : Set \u2192 Set is a functor \u00afF : Nom \u2192Nom such that U \u00afF = FU. Further, an Sf(V)-set lifting of F is a functor \u02c6F : Sf(V)-set \u2192Sf(V)-set such that V \u02c6F = FV . We say that a functor G : Nom \u2192Nom is a lifting if it is a Nom-lifting of some Set-functor F. Notation 3.2 Throughout this work, we will use the bar notation in the above definition to denote functors on Nom that are liftings of Set-endofunctors. Lemma 3.3 A functor G : Nom \u2192Nom is a lifting iff G is a lifting of UGD, and in fact if G is a lifting of F then F = UGD. Proof In the first claim, \u2018if\u2019 is trivial; we prove \u2018only if\u2019 in conjunction with the second claim. So let UG = FU for some Set-functor F; then UGD = FUD = F. \u2293\u2294 Definition 3.4 Let \u02c6F be a Sf(V)-set lifting of the functor F : Set \u2192Set. We say that \u02c6F is Nom-restricting if it preserves nominal sets, i.e. \u02c6F restricts to a functor \u00afF : Nom \u2192Nom (which is, then, a Nom-lifting of F).\n2 In a general locally finitely presentable category the image of c\u2020 is obtained by taking a (strong epi,mono)-factorization of c\u2020, and the union is then obtained as a directed colimit o the resulting subobjects of (\u03bdF, t).\nRecall that a monad-over-functor distributive law between a monad T and a functor F on a category C is a natural transformation \u03bb : T F \u2192FT such that the diagrams\nRecall that a monad-over-functor distributive law between a monad T and a functor F on a category C is a natural transformation \u03bb : T F \u2192FT such that the diagrams F\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/2c74/2c742b3d-5254-4efe-b666-a5ec948af418.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">commute.

Such distributive laws are in bijective correspondence with liftings of F to the Eilenberg-Moore category of T [17].

We will be interested exclusively in Nom-liftings that arise by restricting Sf(V)-set-liftings, i.e. come from a distributive law (3.3); explicitly: Definition 3.5 A distributive law \u03bb of Sf(V) \u00d7 (\u2212) over F is Nom-restricting if the corresponding Sf(V)-set lifting of F is Nom-restricting. One class of Nom-restricting liftings are canonical liftings, introduced next. After that, we introduce the bigger class of localizable liftings, and in the next section we study their rational fixpoints. Recall that every Set-functor F comes with a (tensorial) strength, i.e. a transformation sX,Y : X \u00d7 FY \u2192F(X \u00d7 Y )\nformation\nnatural in X and Y , making the diagrams\n1 \u00d7 FY F(1 \u00d7 Y ) FY \u03b9F Y s1,Y F \u03b9Y\nand\n(X \u00d7 Z) \u00d7 FY F((X \u00d7 Z) \u00d7 Y ) X \u00d7 (Z \u00d7 FY ) X \u00d7 F(Z \u00d7 Y ) F(X \u00d7 (Z \u00d7 Y )) sX\u00d7Z,Y \u03b1X,Z,F Y F \u03b1X,Z,Y X \u00d7 sZ,Y sX,Z\u00d7Y\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\ncommute, where \u03b9 : 1 \u00d7 Id \u2192Id and \u03b1 : (Id \u00d7 Id) \u00d7 Id \u2192Id \u00d7 (Id \u00d7 Id) are the left unitor and the associator, respectively, of the Cartesian monoidal structure [20]. We remark that using \u03b9 and \u03b1, we can rephrase the definition of the monad M \u00d7(\u2212) for a monoid (M, m, e): the unit is\nProof Using (F\u03b9X)\u22121 = F\u03b9\u22121 X , the commutatitivity of the following verifies (3.1):\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/418c/418c13f8-427c-4b7e-83b1-4b7499593d70.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Also using F(\u03b1\u22121 M,M,X) = (F\u03b1M,M,X)\u22121, note that</div>\nAlso using F(\u03b1\u22121 M,M,X) = (F\u03b1M,M,X)\u22121, note that\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/6c5e/6c5ee83a-20ae-47f5-81f7-f19b8c6908bb.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">commutes, so sM, satisfies (3.2), and hence is a distributive law.</div>\nM, Definition 3.7 For M = Sf(V), we refer to the distributive law described in Lemma 3.6 as the canonical distributive law of Sf(V) \u00d7 (\u2212) over F, and to the arising Sf(V)-set lifting of F as the canonical Sf(V)-set lifting of F. Lemma 3.8 The canonical Sf(V)-set lifting of a finitary Set-functor is Nomrestricting.\n\u2293\u2294\nProof Let F : Set \u2192Set be finitary, let \u00afF denote the canonical Sf(V)-set lifting of F, let X be a nominal set with nominal structure \u03b1 : Sf(V) \u00d7 X \u2192X, and let x \u2208FX. We have to show that x has finite support in \u00afFX. Since F is finitary, x : 1 \u2192FX factors through some Fi with i a subset inclusion S \u0592\u2192X of a finite subset S. Then W = supp(S) supports x: Put G = Sf(V \\ W), let m : G \u2192Sf(V) be the evident subgroup inclusion, and let \u03c0 \u2208G. Since W supports S and S is finite, the elements of G fix S pointwise, i.e.\ncommutes, where outr denotes the right-hand product projection. With \u03b2 denoting the nominal structure on FX and s the strength (so sSf(V), is the canonical distributive law), we have that\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0c76/0c7630fc-75e4-4f00-8d9f-90363b2cd81b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\ncommutes, where the unlabelled triangle commutes by Diagram (3.6) and the decomposition of x in the upper right hand part is by the strength law (3.4). This shows that \u03c0 \u00b7 x = x, as required. \u2293\u2294 Definition 3.9 We refer to the lifting of a Set-functor F to Nom arising from Lemma 3.8 as the canonical lifting of F. Moreover, a lifting G : Nom \u2192Nom is canonical if it is a canonical lifting of some functor (i.e. a canonical lifting of UGD). The canonical lifting is the expected lifting for many Set-functors: Example 3.10 (1) For a polynomial functor F\u03a3 on Set (see Example 2.13(3)) the canonical lifting \u00afF\u03a3 maps a nominal set (X, \u00b7) to the expected coproduct of finite products in Nom where each \u03a3n is equipped with the trivial nominal structure. (2) The canonical lifting of the finite powerset functor Pf maps a nominal set (X, \u00b7) to Pf(X) equipped with the usual nominal structure, which is given by \u03c0 \u00b7 Y = {\u03c0 \u00b7 y | y \u2208Y } for Y \u2208Pf(X). (3) The canonical lifting of the bag functor \u00afB maps a nominal set (X, \u00b7) to B(X) equipped with the nominal structure that acts elementwise as in the previous item.\n(3.6)\n(4) An interesting more general class of examples are Joyal\u2019s analytic functors [18, 19]. An endofunctor F on Set is analytic if it is the left Kan extension of a functor from the category B of natural numbers and bijections to Set along the inclusion. These are described explicitly as follows. For a subgroup G of S(n), n < \u03c9, the symmetrized representable functor maps a set X to the set Xn/G of orbits under the action of G on Xn by coordinate interchange, i.e., Xn/G is the quotient of Xn modulo the equivalence \u223cG with (x0, . . . , xn\u22121) \u223cG (y0, . . . , yn\u22121) iff (x\u03c0(0), . . . , x\u03c0(n\u22121)) = (y0, . . . , yn\u22121) for some \u03c0 \u2208G. It is not difficult to prove that an endofunctor on Set is analytic iff it is a coproduct of symmetrized representables. So every analytic functor H can be written in the form\nClearly every analytic functor is finitary, and Joyal proved in [18,19] that a finitary endofunctor on Set is analytic iff it weakly preserves wide pullbacks. The canonical lifting of an analytic functor F is given by equipping for any nominal set (X, \u00b7) the quotients Xn/G with the obvious group action:\nNote that the bag functor from the previous item is the special case where we take An,G = 1 for G = Sf(n) and 0 else, for every n. The finite power-set functor is not analytic. (5) Another interesting analytic functor is the cyclic shift functor Z that maps a set X to the set of all assignments of elements of X to the corners of any regular polygon (modulo rotation of the polygon). In fact, this is the analytic functor obtained by putting An,G = 1 for G generated by the cyclic right shift \u03c0(i) = (i+1) mod n for i = 0, . . . , n\u22121, and An,G = 0 otherwise. The canonical lifing of Z is as expected: given a nominal set Y , the nominal structure on \u00af ZY acts by applying the original action on Y to the elements labelling the corners of a regular polygon. However, many important functors on Nom are liftings but not canonical liftings. Example 3.11 (1) The simplest examples are constant functors \u00afKX = (Y, \u00b7 ) for a nontrivial nominal set (Y, \u00b7 ). The functor \u00afK is clearly a lifting of the constant functor KX = Y on Set but the canonical lifting of K is constantly DY . (2) Similarly, more interesting composite functors such as the functor \u00afLX = V + X \u00d7 X + V \u00d7 X mentioned in the introduction with the standard action on V, i.e. \u03c0\u00b7v = \u03c0(v) for v \u2208V, or the functors \u00afB(\u2212)+V or \u00af Z(\u2212)+V are non-canonical liftings. We therefore identify a property of distributive laws that (in combination with restriction of liftings to Nom) suffices to enable our main result on rational fixpoints of liftings: Definition 3.12 Let F : Set \u2192Set be a functor. A monad-over-functor distributive law \u03bb : Sf(V) \u00d7 F(\u2212) \u2192F(Sf(V) \u00d7 \u2212) is localizable if for any X and any W \u2286V, \u03bb restricts to a natural transformation \u03bbW : Sf(W)\u00d7FX \u2192F(Sf(W)\u00d7(\u2212) ), i.e. we have \u03bbX \u00b7 (mW \u00d7 idF X) = F(mW \u00d7 idX) \u00b7 \u03bbW X where mW : Sf(W) \u2192Sf(V) is the\n(3.7)\nevident subgroup inclusion. A lifting G : Nom \u2192Nom is localizable if it is induced by a Nom-restricting localizable distributive law.\nevident subgroup inclusion. A lifting G : Nom \u2192Nom is localizable if it is induced by a Nom-restricting localizable distributive law. Lemma 3.13 Canonical liftings are localizable. Proof The equation \u03bbX \u00b7 (mW \u00d7 idF X) = F(mW \u00d7 idX) \u00b7 \u03bbW X postulated in Definition 3.12 is an instance of naturality of the strength in the left argument. \u2293\u2294 Example 3.14 By the previous lemma, in particular the identity functor on Nom is a localizable lifting. Moreover, all constant functors on Nom are trivially localizable. Lemma 3.15 The class of finitary and mono-preserving localizable liftings is closed under finite products, arbitrary coproducts, and functor composition. Proof Finitarity and preservation of monos are clear. The lifting property is immediate from creation of finite products and coproducts by U : Nom \u2192Set. Since moreover finite products and coproducts in Nom are formed as in Sf(V)-set, it is clear that they preserve the property of being induced by a Nom-restricting distributive law. It remains to show preservation of localizability by the mentioned constructions. Let W \u2286V. Finite products: Since the terminal functor is constant, it suffices to consider binary products G \u00d7 H of functors G, H on Nom induced by Nom-restricting localizable distributive laws \u03bbG, \u03bbH. Indeed, G \u00d7 H is induced by the distributive law\nProof The equation \u03bbX \u00b7 (mW \u00d7 idF X) = F(mW \u00d7 idX) \u00b7 \u03bbW X postulated in Definition 3.12 is an instance of naturality of the strength in the left argument. \u2293\u2294\nand if \u03c0 \u2208Sf(W) then the right-hand side is in (G \u00d7 H)(Sf(W) \u00d7 X). Coproducts: For i \u2208I, let the functors Gi on Nom be induced by Nom-restricting localizable distributive laws \u03bbGi. Then G = \ufffd i\u2208I Gi is induced by the distributive laws\nwhere ini denotes the i-th coproduct injection, and if \u03c0 \u2208Sf(W) then the righthand side is in \ufffdGi(Sf(W) \u00d7 X). Functor composition: Let G, H be functors on Nom induced by Nom-restricting localizable distributive laws \u03bbG, \u03bbH. Then GH is induced by the distributive law\n(\u03bbGH)X(\u03c0, x) = G(\u03bbH)X((\u03bbG)HX(\u03c0, x)),\nand if \u03c0 \u2208Sf(W) then the right-hand side is in GH(Sf(W) \u00d7 X).\nDefinition 3.16 Recall that the class of polynomial functors is the smallest class of endofunctors on Nom that contains all constant functors and the identity functor and is closed under coproducts and finite products. Note in particular that the functors in Example 3.11 are polynomial. By Example 3.14 and Lemma 3.15, we have Lemma 3.17 All polynomial functors are finitary localizable liftings and preserve monos. We see next that there are liftings that fail to be localizable, and indeed our example does not allow the desired lifting of rational fixpoints from Set to Nom:\n\u2293\u2294\nExample 3.18 Consider the functor FX = V \u00d7X with the lifting \u02dcF(X, \u00b7) = (V, \u00b7)\u00d7 (X, \u22c6), where \u00b7 is the usual action on V and \u03c0 \u22c6x is defined as g \u00b7 \u03c0 \u00b7 g\u22121 \u00b7 x for some fixed permutation g : V \u2192V such that there is a name v0 \u2208V for which the names gn \u00b7 v0 =: vn are pairwise distinct for n \u2208Z. This is well-defined because by Remark 2.7, (X, \u00b7) uniquely extends to a S(V)-set. This lifting corresponds to the distributive law defined by\nSince V is orbit-finite, c is lfp. Moreover, c is a subcoalgebra of \u033a \u02dcF, i.e. the coalgebra homomorphism c\u2020 : (V, c) \u2192\u033a( \u02dcF, r) is monic, because v can be recovered from c\u2020(v) via v = outl \u25e6\u02dcFc\u2020 \u25e6c(v) = outl \u25e6r \u25e6c\u2020(v). However, (V, c) considered as an F-coalgebra in Set is not lfp, because the smallest subcoalgebra containing v0 is {gn \u00b7v0 | n \u22650}, which is infinite by the choice of g and v0. (2) The coalgebra d : 1 \u2192F1 defined by d(\u2217) = (v0, \u2217) \u2208V \u00d7 1 (where 1 = {\u2217}) is, trivially, lfp and a subcoalgebra of \u033aF. The unique coalgebra homomorphism 1 \u2192\u033aF defines an element d\u2020 \u2208\u033aF. Assuming some Sf(V)-set structure \u00b7 on \u033aF such that r : (\u033aF, \u00b7) \u2192\u02dcF(\u033aF, \u00b7) is equivariant, the support of d\u2020 must contain v0 and the support of d\u2020 in (\u033aF, \u22c6), which is the support of g\u22121 \u00b7 d\u2020 in (\u033aF, \u00b7). Iterating this observation we find that the support of d\u2020 contains g\u2212n \u00b7 v0 for all n \u2208N, hence is infinite. Remark 3.19 The functor \u02dcF from the previous example is naturally isomorphic to the harmless (in fact, polynomial) functor\n\u00afF(X, \u00b7) = (V, \u00b7) \u00d7 (X, \u00b7),\nwhere the isomorphism \u03c4 : \u00afF \u2192\u02dcF is given by \u03c4X(v, x) = (v, g \u00b7 x)\nusing the fact that the action of Sf(V) on the nominal set X extends uniquely to an action of S(V) (Remark 2.7.3). In fact, \u03c4X is clearly bijective. We have to show that \u03c4X is equivariant: \u03c4X(\u03c0 \u00b7 v, \u03c0 \u00b7 x) = \ufffd \u03c0 \u00b7 v, g \u00b7 \u03c0 \u00b7 x\ufffd= \ufffd \u03c0 \u00b7 v, g \u00b7 \u03c0 \u00b7 g\u22121 \u00b7 g \u00b7 x\ufffd= \ufffd \u03c0 \u00b7 v, \u03c0 \u22c6(g \u00b7 x)\ufffd . Finally, we compute the naturality square for an equivariant map f : X \u2192Y : \u03c4Y \u00b7 (idV \u00d7 f)(v, x) = (v, g \u00b7 f(x)) = (v, f(g \u00b7 x)) = (idV \u00d7 f) \u00b7 \u03c4X(v, x).\nThis fact may be slightly surprising, and shows that lifting of the rational fixpoint is a representation-dependent property of functors on Nom rather than an intrinsic one; it serves only as a technical tool in the computation of rational fixpoints. The isomorphism \u02dcF \u223c= \u00afF implies that the counterexample to localizability is not only somewhat contrived but can also be circumvented; that is, instead of calculating the rational fixpoint of \u02dcF we can calculate that of \u00afF, which is perfectly amenable to our methods. In fact we have no example of a lifting that is not isomorphic to a localizable one. In Example 3.18, we have seen that Nom-restricting distributive laws need not be localizable. As the following simple example shows, localizability and Nomrestriction are in fact independent, i.e. localizable distributive laws also need not be Nom-restricting: Example 3.20 Let (Y, \u00b7) be some non-nominal Sf(V)-set. Consider the constant functor KX = Y with the distributive law \u03bbX : Sf(V) \u00d7 KX \u2192K(Sf(V) \u00d7 X) defined by\n\u03bbX(\u03c0, y) = \u03c0 \u00b7 y (y \u2208Y ).\nSince K is constant, \u03bb is trivially localizable. However, \u03bb induces, as its Sf(V)-se lifting, the constant functor \u00afK = (Y, \u00b7), and hence fails to be Nom-restricting.\nSince K is constant, \u03bb is trivially localizable. However, \u03bb induces, as its Sf(V)-set lifting, the constant functor \u00afK = (Y, \u00b7), and hence fails to be Nom-restricting.\n4 Rational Fixpoints of Localizable Liftings\nWe proceed to analyse rational fixpoints of liftings \u00afF in relation to rational fixpoints of the underlying functor F. We have seen in Example 3.18 that even when F is finitary, the rational fixpoint of \u00afF in general need not be a lifting of the rational fixpoint of F (in contrast to the situation with initial algebras). Our main result (Theorem 4.14) establishes that for localizable liftings, the rational fixpoint of F does lift to the rational fixpoint of \u00afF. As a consequence, we also obtain concrete descriptions of the rational fixpoint for functors on Nom that are quotients of lifted functors (but not themselves liftings of Set-functors) (Section 5), e.g. functors associated to a binding signature (Section 6.1).\nAssumption 4.1 In this section, assume that \u00afF : Nom \u2192Nom is a localizable lifting of a finitary functor F : Set \u2192Set.\nLemma 4.2 If for a coalgebra c : C \u2192\u00afFC the underlying coalgebra c : C \u2192FC is lfp in Set, then c : C \u2192\u00afFC is lfp in Nom.\nProof Let x \u2208C, and let O be the orbit of x; we have to construct an orbit-finite subcoalgebra Q of C containing x. The lfp property of (C, c) in Set provides us with a finite subcoalgebra (P, p) with x \u2208P. We take Q \u2286C to be the union of the orbits of the elements of P, i.e. the closure of P in C under the Sf(V)-action. Then Q is a nominal set; applying \u00afF to the equivariant inclusion Q \u2192C, we obtain that FQ is closed under the Sf(V)-action in FC. Note also that Q is orbit-finite since P is finite. We are done once show that Q is closed under the coalgebra structure c. Let y \u2208P and \u03c0 \u2208Sf(V), so that \u03c0 \u00b7 y \u2208Q. Since P is a subcoalgebra of (C, c) in Set, we have p(y) = c(y) and hence\nc(\u03c0 \u00b7 y) = \u03c0 \u00b7 c(y) = \u03c0 \u00b7 p(y).\nSince p(y) \u2208FP \u2286FQ and FQ is closed under the Sf(V)-action in FC, it follows that c(\u03c0 \u00b7 y) \u2208FQ. \u2293\u2294 Lemma 4.3 If c : C \u2192\u00afFC is an orbit-finite coalgebra in Nom, then c : C \u2192FC is lfp in Set. Proof First define the following closure operator on subsets X of C: C\u2113(X) = {y \u2208C | supp(y) \u2286\ufffd x\u2208X supp(x)}.\n\ufffd By Lemma 2.11, C\u2113preserves finite sets. Now let x \u2208C. Pick a subset O \u2286C that contains precisely one element from each orbit of C, and put P = C\u2113({x} \u222aO), with inP denoting the embedding P \u058c C. Since O is finite, P is finite, and since F is finitary, there exists a finite set Q \u2286C such that c \u00b7 inP factorizes through FinQ : FQ \u2192FC. The subset W = C\u2113(P \u222aQ) \u2286C is finite as well, and we have:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/36ae/36aee567-600f-4b4b-8016-44ff79be5244.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nNow let G be the finite subgroup of Sf(V) given by the permutations of supp(W and note that supp(W) = supp(P \u222aQ).

We will now prove that the lefthand map \u03b1\u2032 is surjective. To see this, let y \u2208W. Then there are z \u2208O \u2286P and \u03c0 \u2208Sf(V) such that \u03c0 \u00b7 z = y, because O contains precisely one element from each orbit. Consider the factorization of \u03c0 into \u03c0 = \u03c0|supp(z) \u00b7 g as in Remark 2.4. Then g fixes every element of supp(z), so g \u00b7 z = z, and \u03c0|supp(z) fixes every element not contained in supp(z) \u222a\u03c0 \u00b7 supp(z). Since \u03c0 \u00b7 z = y we have \u03c0 \u00b7 supp(z) = supp(y), and because y \u2208W and z \u2208P \u2286W we know that supp(z) \u222asupp(y) \u2286supp(W). Thus \u03c0|supp(z) fixes every element not contained in supp(W) and therefore \u03c0|supp(z) lies in G. It follows that\n\u03b1\u2032(\u03c0|supp(z), z) = \u03c0|supp(z) \u00b7 z = \u03c0|supp(z) \u00b7 g \u00b7 z = \u03c0 \u00b7 z = y, showing \u03b1\u2032 to be surjective as desired.\nshowing \u03b1\u2032 to be surjective as desired.\nNow fix a splitting d : W \u058c G \u00d7 P of \u03b1\u2032, i.e. we have \u03b1\u2032 \u00b7 d = idW . Denote by \u03b1\u2032\u2032 : G \u00d7 W \u2192C the restriction of \u03b1.

Let (\u03c0, x) \u2208Sf(V)\u00d7\u033aF. Since \u033aF is an lfp coalgebra, we obtain an orbit-finite subcoalgebra (S, s) of \u033aF containing x.

It is easy to verify that in the case where M is a monad and \u03d5 a distributive law of M over H, the iterated transformation \u03bb(n) is a distributive law of M over Hn.

For its soundness proof, we use that for a finitary set endofunctor the terminal coalgebra can be obtained by an iterative construction that we now recall. Remark 4.9 (1) Let H : Set \u2192Set be a finitary endofunctor. The terminal sequence of H is the op-chain (Hn1)n<\u03c9 with the connecting maps Hn! : Hn+11 \u2192Hn1 for every n < \u03c9.\nIts limit H\u03c91 does not in general yield the terminal coalgebra. However, Worrell [35] shows that by continuing the terminal sequence for \u03c9 more steps, one does obtain the terminal coalgebra. Indeed, denote by \u2113\u03c9,n : H\u03c91 \u2192Hn1 the limit projections and let H\u03c9+n1 = Hn(H\u03c91). We define the connecting map \u2113\u03c9+1,\u03c9 : H\u03c9+11 \u2192H\u03c91 as the unique morphism such that \u2113\u03c9,n \u00b7 \u2113\u03c9+1,\u03c9 = H\u2113\u03c9,n, and by applying H iteratively we obtain \u2113\u03c9+n+1,\u03c9+n = Hn\u2113\u03c9 + 1, \u03c9 : H\u03c9+n+11 \u2192H\u03c9+n1. Worrell proves that the limit of the ensuing op-chain formed by the H\u03c9+n1 is the terminal coalgebra \u03bdH. Moreover, he shows that all connecting morphisms \u2113\u03c9+n+1,\u03c9+n are injective maps; it follows that \u03bdH is actually the intersection of all H\u03c9+n1. (2) Recall that every coalgebra c : C \u2192HC induces a canonical cone cn : C \u2192Hn1, n < \u03c9 + \u03c9 on the above op-chain defined by (transfinite) induction as follows: c0 : C \u21921 is uniquely determined, for isolated steps one has cn+1 = Hcn\u00b7c and for the limit step we define c\u03c9 to be the unique map such that \u2113\u03c9,n \u00b7 c\u03c9 = cn.

Indeed, denote by \u2113\u03c9,n : H\u03c91 \u2192Hn1 the limit projections and let H\u03c9+n1 = Hn(H\u03c91). We define the connecting map \u2113\u03c9+1,\u03c9 : H\u03c9+11 \u2192H\u03c91 as the unique morphism such that \u2113\u03c9,n \u00b7 \u2113\u03c9+1,\u03c9 = H\u2113\u03c9,n, and by applying H iteratively we obtain \u2113\u03c9+n+1,\u03c9+n = Hn\u2113\u03c9 + 1, \u03c9 : H\u03c9+n+11 \u2192H\u03c9+n1.

Moreover, he shows that all connecting morphisms \u2113\u03c9+n+1,\u03c9+n are injective maps; it follows that \u03bdH is actually the intersection of all H\u03c9+n1.

Now it follows from Remark 4.9 that elements x \u2208C and y \u2208D are behaviourally equivalent, i.e. c\u2020(x) = d\u2020(y), if and only if cn(x) = dn(y) for all n < \u03c9. Indeed, necessity is obvious since cn = \u2113\u03c9+\u03c9,n \u00b7c\u2020 (and similarly for d) and sufficiency follows from the fact that all \u2113\u03c9+n,\u03c9 are injective. By hypothesis we have for every x \u2208X that\nand equivalently, c(p1(x)) = d(p2(x)), which completes the proof. \u2293\u2294 Remark 4.11 Consider the nominal sets \u00afF nD(\u033aF) for n < \u03c9 (recalling that DX is X equipped with the trivial nominal structure).

An easy induction thus shows that \u03b2n has the form \u03b2n = \ufffdSf(V) \u00d7 F n(\u033aF) \u03bb(n) \u033aF \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192F n(Sf(V) \u00d7 \u033aF) F n outr \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192F n(\u033aF)\ufffd . (4.2)\n(4.1)\n\u2293\u2294\n(4.2)\nLemma 4.12 For the Sf(V)-set structure from Lemma 4.6, t \u2208\u033aF is supported by\ns(t) = \ufffd supp(r(n)(t)) where r(n) : \u033aF \u2192F n(\u033aF)\nand where the support of r(n)(t) is taken in \u00afF nD(\u033aF).\nProof Let \u03c0 \u2208Fix(s(t)). Abbreviate the coalgebra structure on Sf(V) \u00d7 \u033aF by p := \u03bb\u033aF \u00b7 (idSf(V) \u00d7 r), and recall from Lemma 4.6 that the induced algebra structure on \u033aF is p\u2020.

It follows that the outside of the diagram commutes, and we obtain by Lemma 4.10 that (\u03c0, t) and t are identified in \u03bdF and thus also in its subcoalgebra \u033aF. In other words, \u03c0 \u00b7 t = t with respect to the algebra structure p\u2020 : Sf(V) \u00d7 \u033aF \u2192\u033aF, and therefore s(t) supports t. \u2293\u2294\nLemma 4.13 For t \u2208\u033aF, s(t) is finite.\n# Lemma 4.13 For t \u2208\u033aF, s(t) is finite.\nProof Since \u033aF is lfp in Set, we have a finite subcoalgebra j : (C, c) \u2192(\u033aF, r) containing t.

So let (C, c) be an orbit-finite \u00afF coalgebra. By Lemma 4.3, (C, c) is an lfp F-coalgebra, and thus induces a unique F-coalgebra homomorphism h : (C, c) \u2192(\u033aF, r) (in Set). This homomorphism h : C \u2192\u033aF is equivariant; to see this, recall first that the final F-coalgebra (\u03bdF, t) lifts to the final \u02c6F-coalgebra, where \u02c6F is the lifting of F to Sf(V)-sets induced by the distributive law. Let h\u2032 : (C, c) \u2192(\u03bdF, t) be the unique homomorphism into the final \u02c6F-coalgebra, which is an equivariant map. Recall further that (\u033aF, r) is a subcoalgebra of (\u03bdF, t) via j : \u033aF \u2192\u03bdF, say. Note that the group action on \u033aF has been defined as the restriction of that on \u03bdF, and so j is equivariant. Then clearly j \u00b7h = h\u2032 by finality of \u03bdF; and since j is equivariant and monic it follows that h is equivariant. \u2293\u2294 Example 4.15 (1) For all canonical liftings \u00afF (e.g. the ones we mentioned in Example 3.10), the rational fixpoint \u033a \u00afF is the rational fixpoint \u033aF equipped with the discrete action (cf. Example 2.13). Note that for the cyclic shift functor Z on Set, the final coalgebra consists of all finitely branching trees where the order of the children of any vertex is taken modulo cyclic shifting, and the rational fixpoint is given by all rational such trees; this follows from the results of [3]. (2) Recall that the final coalgebra for LX = V + X \u00d7 X + V \u00d7 X on Set is carried by the set of all \u03bb-trees and the rational fixpoint by the set of all rational \u03bbtrees. It follows that the rational fixpoint of the (non-canonical but localizable) lifting \u00afL where V is equipped with the standard action is carried by the same set with the nominal structure given according to Lemma 4.6; this action applies the standard action of V to the labels of the leaves of \u03bb-trees. (3) For the functor B(\u2212)+V on Set, the final coalgebra is carried by all unordered trees some of whose leaves are labelled in V. The rational fixpoint is then carried by the set of all rational such trees. To obtain the rational fixpoint of the non-canonical lifting \u00afB(\u2212) + V, one equips this set of trees with the action that applies the standard action of V on the labels of leaves. This follows once again from Lemma 4.6 and Theorem 4.14. A similar description can be given for the functor \u00af Z+V; we obtain rational trees some of whose leaves are labelled in V and where the order of the children of a vertex is only determined up to cyclic shift.\n# 5 Quotients of Nom-Functors\nWe next consider quotient functors on Nom. For the rest of this section we assume a finitary functor H : Nom \u2192Nom that is a quotient of a finitary functor F : Nom \u2192Nom, i.e. we have a natural transformation q : F \u0589 H with surjective components. We present a sufficient condition on coalgebras for F and H that ensures that the rational fixpoint \u033aH is a quotient of the rational fixpoint \u033aF. We then introduce a simple, if ad-hoc, condition on F that ensures that the mentioned\nsufficient condition is satisfied for all quotients H of F. Combining this result with the ones from the previous section, we obtain a description of the rational fixpoint of endofunctors H on Nom arising from binding signatures and exponentiation. Definition 5.1 An H-coalgebra (C, c) is a quotient of an F-coalgebra (A, a) if there is a surjective H-coalgebra homomorphism h : (A, qA \u00b7 a) \u2192(C,",
