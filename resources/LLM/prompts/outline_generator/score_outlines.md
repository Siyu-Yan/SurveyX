- Constrains: The evaluation must be objective and based solely on the criteria provided. 
- Evaluation Criteria:
### **Primary Outline:**

#### 1. **The first section should be "Introduction," and the last section should be "Conclusion."**
- **100-90**: The outline correctly starts with "Introduction" and ends with "Conclusion" without any deviations. Both sections are clearly identified and logically placed.
- **89-80**: The outline starts with "Introduction" and ends with "Conclusion," but there may be slight formatting or organizational issues (e.g., extra content after "Conclusion" that isnâ€™t relevant).
- **79-70**: The outline includes "Introduction" and "Conclusion," but they are misplaced, such as "Conclusion" not being the last section or "Introduction" containing non-relevant material.
- **69-60**: The outline contains one of the two (either "Introduction" or "Conclusion") but not both, leading to incomplete structure.
- **59 and below**: The outline fails to include either an "Introduction" or a "Conclusion," demonstrating a lack of basic structure.

#### 2. **A "Background," "Definitions," or "Preliminary" section is needed after the 'Introduction' to introduce and explain the core concepts.**
- **100-90**: The outline includes a well-placed section immediately after the "Introduction" that covers background, definitions, or preliminaries, providing essential context for the survey.
- **89-80**: The section is present and fulfills its role but may not provide enough detail or clarity in its purpose.
- **79-70**: The section is included, but it is incomplete or lacks sufficient clarity, making it hard to follow the core concepts.
- **69-60**: The section is missing or incorrectly placed, and the core concepts are not sufficiently introduced or defined.
- **59 and below**: There is no effort to provide a background, definitions, or preliminary section, making it difficult to understand key concepts in the paper.

#### 3. **Avoid unrelated sections like "Ethical Considerations" and "Applications."**
- **100-90**: The outline avoids any mention of unrelated sections like "Ethical Considerations" and "Applications." All sections are highly relevant to the topic.
- **89-80**: There may be a minor mention of unrelated sections, but they are not central or prominent in the outline.
- **79-70**: Some unrelated sections are included, but they are limited in scope and do not dominate the outline.
- **69-60**: Multiple unrelated sections are present, which distracts from the focus of the survey.
- **59 and below**: The outline is cluttered with irrelevant sections that detract significantly from the purpose of the survey.

#### 4. **The last section "Conclusion" shouldn't contain any subsections.**
- **100-90**: The "Conclusion" section is well-structured and does not contain any subsections, keeping the summary concise and focused.
- **89-80**: The "Conclusion" section is present but may include a small or unnecessary subsection.
- **79-70**: The "Conclusion" section contains multiple subsections, but they do not interfere heavily with the overall focus of the summary.
- **69-60**: The "Conclusion" contains several subsections, making it less focused and cluttered.
- **59 and below**: The "Conclusion" is poorly structured, heavily divided into subsections, or missing altogether.

### **Secondary Outline:**

#### 1. **In the "Introduction" section, include a subsection like "Structure of the Survey" that provides an overview of the content.**
- **100-90**: The "Introduction" section contains a clear subsection like "Structure of the Survey," offering a concise overview of the paper's content and layout.
- **89-80**: The "Structure of the Survey" subsection is present but may not fully capture the flow or scope of the survey.
- **79-70**: The overview is included but may be misplaced, unclear, or lacking in detail, leaving the reader uncertain about the structure of the paper.
- **69-60**: The subsection is poorly developed or missing, resulting in a less coherent introduction.
- **59 and below**: No effort is made to provide an overview of the survey's structure, leaving the reader confused about the layout of the paper.

#### 2. **Each section should contain no more than five subsections.**
- **100-90**: Each section contains a maximum of five subsections, making the outline structured, organized, and easy to follow.
- **89-80**: Most sections follow this rule, but there may be one or two sections with an extra subsection without causing much confusion.
- **79-70**: Some sections contain more than five subsections, making them harder to follow and potentially overcomplicated.
- **69-60**: Multiple sections exceed the five-subsection limit, leading to a cluttered and overly detailed outline.
- **59 and below**: The outline consistently exceeds the subsection limit, making it difficult to navigate.

#### 3. **Purpose: Subsections should break down the broader topic of a section into more specific components/aspects.**
- **100-90**: The subsections effectively break down the broader topic into clear, relevant, and focused components, aiding understanding.
- **89-80**: The subsections generally serve this purpose, though one or two may lack specificity or focus.
- **79-70**: Some subsections are vague or not well-aligned with the broader topic, making it difficult to see the connection to the main section.
- **69-60**: Many subsections are not focused or do not break down the topic adequately, resulting in confusion or redundancy.
- **59 and below**: The subsections fail to break down the topics meaningfully, and their purpose is unclear.

#### 4. **Hierarchy: Subsections should fit naturally within the parent section.**
- **100-90**: The hierarchy is clear, and each subsection fits naturally within its parent section, offering finer granularity on the topic.
- **89-80**: The hierarchy is generally logical, but there may be slight inconsistencies in the placement of one or two subsections.
- **79-70**: The hierarchy is somewhat unclear, with some subsections not fitting well within their parent section or seeming out of place.
- **69-60**: The hierarchy is confusing, and several subsections appear misplaced or unrelated to the main section.
- **59 and below**: The hierarchy is poorly organized, and subsections do not align with their parent sections.

#### 5. **Consistency in naming and formatting.**
- **100-90**: All subsections follow a consistent naming and formatting convention, providing clarity and uniformity throughout the outline.
