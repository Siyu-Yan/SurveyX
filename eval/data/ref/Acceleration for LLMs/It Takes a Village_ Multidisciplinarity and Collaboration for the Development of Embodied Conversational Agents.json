Engaging in activities outside of one's core research to acquire peripheral skills can  impede innovation and potentially restrict the outcomes within the boundaries of those acquired skills. A proposal to tackle this challenge  is creating collaborative communities of experts from the contributing disciplines to the field of ECAs that via clearly defined roles,  expectations and communication channels can help extend the field of ECA research.   CCS CONCEPTS \u2022 Human-centered computing \u2022 Human computer interaction (HCI) \u2022 HCI design and evaluation methods  Additional Keywords and Phrases: Embodied conversational agents, multimodal interaction, speech interaction, voice  interface, multidisciplinary collaboration. \n# 1 INTRODUCTION\nThe field of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) is  multidisciplinary and constitutes a subcategory of  conversational  agents  and  conversational  user  interfaces.  The term \u201cEmbodied Conversational Agent\u201d was  coined by Justine Cassell in 2000 and is defined as  follows: \n\u201c[ECAs are] computer interfaces that can hold  up their end of the conversation, interfaces  that realize conversational behaviors as a  function of the demands of dialogue and as a  function of emotion, personality, and social  conversation\u201d [8]  \nIn layman\u2019s terms ECAs are virtual characters with  the ability to converse with a human through verbal  (speech) and/or non-verbal communication (text and/or  gestures) [9].   Previous research has identified the possibilities of  using ECAs for tourism and culture [3,14], business  applications [11,17,18], journalism [5], healthcare  [12,27,28], as companions [6], as sales agents [1,7,13],  for military training [19,23], for psychological support  [20], for education [2, 10] and in various other roles.  Even though recent technological advancements are  making the development of ECAs easier and relatively  cost effective for non- experts, it is still a complex and  time-consuming process that demands expertise and a \nwide array of skills. Additionally, the results are a long  way from industrial level agents used in commercial  games.  It also limits research on the capabilities of the  researcher as they spend time on tasks beyond their  research focus which hinders their progress.  Previous research has also shown that individual  ECA attributes can affect the interaction as information  is conveyed by verbal, non-verbal and extra-linguistic  channels [16].  A more advanced ECA (for example  ECAs using multimodal input such as face recognition  and natural language) can be more believable than their  simplistic counterparts; the complexity of those agents  though, comes with challenges as these systems are  prone to mistakes (e.g., misinterpreting semantics of  natural language) and demand more development time  and expertise. One way to tackle these problems is to use  more simplified approaches (e.g., decision tree  mechanisms or simplistic graphics) but they also make  for a less realistic experience. Trade-offs, such as the  ones mentioned above, make finding the optimal  approach in a specific setting a nontrivial task [16,21].  \n# 2 MULTIDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES\nEmbodied conversational agents are the result of many  contributing disciplines. Those disciplines differ for  each ECA depending on its capabilities, purposes, and  modes of interaction. For example, an ECA that uses  speech input needs speech recognition and speech-totext technology, while ECAs with text input do not. In  general, ECAs are by their nature multidisciplinary as  shown in Figure 1.  Each discipline contributes to specific ECA aspects.  Computer science contributes to the aspects of natural  language processing, artificial intelligence, image  recognition and/or speech synthesis and recognition [4].  Linguistics contributes to dialogue design, speech  patterns, semantics, dictionary and more [4]. Art and  design contribute to the areas of 3D and/or 2D design,  computer graphics, animation, character design, art, and  overall visual representation [16]. Cognitive science,  psychology, anthropology, and sociology contribute to \nmotivation,  perception,  engagement,  satisfaction,  affordances,  biases  and  more  [4,24].  Finally,  communication studies and interaction design contribute  to user experience design, user interface design,  usability, and accessibility [4].  \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f1c9/f1c9beaf-2696-42a6-a5b2-c68df1f1d059.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1Contributing disciplines to the field of ECAs</div>\n3 COLLABORATION IN ECA DEVELOPMENT  Collaboration between researchers and practitioners  from different disciplines is especially important in an  academic setting where resources and time are often  limited.   Interdisciplinary collaboration can lead to the  extension of the ECA development boundaries by  combining expertise from different fields to address  domain-specific challenges. Due to their versatility,  ECAs can be used in multiple domains and having  multiple points of view can lead to innovation fostering,  enhanced creativity as well as more natural interaction  and increased usability.  Effective collaboration in ECA development projects  can be challenging mainly due to resource limitations,  lack of trust, communication hurdles or lack of common  research interests and vision. However, it should be  treated as an opportunity for multidisciplinary research,  networking, and future collaborations. One way to  overcome the challenges is by adopting strategies for \neffective collaboration such as trust building, ensuring  accountability and productivity, clearly defined goals,  and vision, providing regular feedback and effective  communication channels [25]. These solutions can be  applied to in person but also in remote collaborations  that became even more prevalent in the post-pandemic  era.  \n# 4 CASE STUDIES AND EXAMPLES \nA real-world example of a successful collaborative  project between an academic and an industrial partner in  ECA development is Susa. Susa is a conversational  agent that promotes teamwork and collaborative  practices. The study provides empirical data on codesigning with end-users, based on the principles of  design thinking. This project is a collaboration between  the National Institute of Public Health from the  University of Southern Denmark and Gnist Denmark, a  company that translates behavioral design into practical  solutions [26]. Regarding the authors' contributions, the  statement demonstrates that the study design and project  idea were developed collaboratively by the academic  and industrial partners. The industrial partners were  responsible for the development of the ECA and  organized the user workshops. Data collection was a  cooperation of members from both the academic and  industrial partners, while the analysis was primarily  conducted by the academic partners. \n# 5 FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS \nThe development of ECAs requires multidisciplinary  collaboration in response to emerging technological  developments. The increasing use of immersive technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, \n# REFERENCES\npresents new opportunities and challenges for ECA  development. Research conducted on ECAs, whether in  immersive applications [22] or more conventional media  [15], highlights certain constraints that can be  effectively mitigated through multidisciplinary teams  relying on cross-school collaborations or collaborations  between academia and industry. These limitations  include among other things the animation or the visual  representation of the agents which can affect the  interaction [15,22].   Furthermore, alongside the rapid technological  advancements, the emergence of ethical concerns and  the need for inclusivity across diverse user populations  add further complexity to the development lifecycle of  ECAs.  Therefore, multidisciplinary collaboration can have  an impact on ECA research as the individual  development tasks can be distributed to parties with the  relevant expertise while the researcher can focus on the  task at hand. \n# 6 CONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, multidisciplinary collaboration for the  development of ECAs can alleviate the pressure of development by an individual. Beyond the need for  expertise on multiple disciplines or acquiring peripheral  skills to the main research focus, researchers need to respond to emerging technological developments as  well.  Previous  examples  have  proved  that multidisciplinary collaboration can be very beneficial  and initiatives for promoting these collaborations should  be considered in the ECA community. \n",
