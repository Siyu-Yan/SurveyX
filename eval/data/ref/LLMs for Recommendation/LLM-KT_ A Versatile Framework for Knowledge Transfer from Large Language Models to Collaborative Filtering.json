Index Terms\u2014Large Language Model (LLM), recommender systems, knowledge transfer, RecBole framework\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMany recommender systems use Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods to model user preferences and match items to them [1]\u2013[3]. However, these models often struggle to understand nuanced relationships and adapt to dynamic useritem interactions [4], [5]. To tackle this issue, applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendations has been actively studied since LLMs offer new ways to represent knowledge with their strong reasoning capabilities. As a result, current studies have integrated LLMs into various stages of recommender systems, from open-world knowledge generation [6], [7] to candidate ranking [8], [9]. Since LLMs are expensive to use, recently, several works proposed to directly use LLM for improving the quality of CF models by performing knowledge transfer (e.g., KAR [10],\nThe work was partially prepared within the framework of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE).\nLLM-CF [9]). They create textual features from reasoning chains of LLM and integrate them as input to CF models. However, such an approach limits their applicability to only context-aware models, making their direct usage impossible for other types of CF models that don\u2019t handle input features. Given these limitations, we developed a method that extends the applicability of knowledge transfer from LLMs to a broader range of CF models. We introduce \u201cLLM-KT\u201d, a novel framework that facilitates seamless integration with various CF models and provides a robust environment for testing and modifying the approach. Our framework enables efficient knowledge transfer by embedding LLM-generated features into the intermediate layers of CF models, training the models to reconstruct these features as a pretext task internally. This process allows the CF model to develop a more refined understanding of user preferences, resulting in more accurate recommendations. Experiments on two wellknown benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of CF models (+ up to 21% improvement in NDCG@10) while applying to a broader range of models than existing approaches and achieving results comparable to the state-of-the-art KAR [10] in context-aware setting.\n# II. PROPOSED METHOD\nThe primary concept of our knowledge transfer method is to let the CF model reconstruct user preferences from the LLM within a specific internal layer without altering its architecture. This approach mirrors the intuitive process of identifying user interests in the early layers and making recommendations based on these learned interests in the later layers.\n# A. Proposed Knowledge Transfer\nOur method consists of the following steps. Profile Generation. First, we use an LLM to generate short preference descriptions for each user based on their user-item interaction data. Following the terminology from [10]\u2013[12], we\nrefer to these descriptions as \u201cprofiles\u201d. Notably, any LLMbased framework can be used for this process, making our method flexible and adaptable to various scenarios [10], [11]. This flexibility allows the framework to accommodate different LLMs and approaches for generating personalized profiles, enhancing its adaptability to various use cases. To maintain efficiency and reduce the number of calls to pretrained LLMs, we create these profiles by independently processing each user\u2019s interactions using customized interest reasoning prompts. For our dataset, we used the following prompt structure: \u201cBased on the user\u2019s ratings, provide a general summary of their preferences, paying attention to... The response should be organized into several parts...\u201d. As can be seen, we explicitly define the required components of the response to ensure the consistency of representations across users. A typical profile might look like this: \u201cIt seems that you enjoy a mix of classic and modern movies, with a preference for...\u201d. Profile Embedding. We apply a pre-trained text embedding model to convert the textual profiles into dense embeddings. In our experiments, \u201ctext-embedding-ada-002\u201d is used. Training with auxiliary pretext task. We add an auxiliary pretext task for a given CF model to reconstruct user profiles in a predefined internal layer. This is done without altering the model\u2019s architecture using a weighted sum of the model\u2019s loss and a reconstruction loss with the weight \u03b1 \u2208[0, 1]:\n(1)\nHere, Lmodel denotes the model-specific loss of a chosen CF model, e.g., BCE (Binary Cross Entropy) for interaction prediction, MSE (Mean Squared Error) for rating prediction, etc.). The reconstruction loss, denoted as LKT , is defined as follows. Let Pu represent the profile embedding of user u, and let Zu denote the output of the Kth layer of the CF model after processing the interactions of user u. Generally, the knowledge-transfer loss is defined as:\n(2)\nwhere Trans is a transformation function that aligns profile embedding to layer representation space. For simplicity, we utilized a nonlearnable Trans function to match the dimensions of profile embeddings with the dimensions of the model\u2019s internal layers. Although our framework supports any dimensionality reduction method, we selected UMAP [13] for our experiments because it preserves the distances between embeddings more effectively than conventional PCA (Principal Component Analysis) [14] and can reduce dimensions to any desired number, unlike t-SNE (tdistributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) [15]. It enables the transformed embeddings to maintain relationships captured by LLM profiles. Our framework supports several options for reconstruction loss. AS RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) produced the best results, we used it in the remaining part.\n# B. Training process\nWe train a CF model with LLM knowledge transfer for N epochs during two phases:\nPhase 1: Knowledge transfer. During the first N/2 epochs, we train the model using an auxiliary pretext task and a combined loss function, as defined in equation 1. This phase optimizes the model for learning to reconstruct LLMgenerated features together with the recommendation task. Phase 2: Fine-tuning. After completing the knowledge transfer, we remove the reconstruction loss and train the model for the remaining N/2 epochs, focusing solely on the prediction task to optimize the model for accurate recommendations.\n# A. General Pipeline\nWe developed a flexible experimentation framework (see Fig. 1) on top of RecBole [16], which allows seamless integration of LLM-generated features into CF models. The framework is designed to enable users to define complex experimental pipelines using a single configuration file, offering a versatile solution for knowledge transfer and finetuning processes in CF models. By supporting a variety of configuration options and predefined commands, it empowers researchers and developers to conduct experiments that explore different aspects of integration.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/92a0/92a02309-ad17-452e-b070-31d7a2bf9931.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFig. 1. Proposed LLM-KT framework. A user can set up an experimental config, selecting the components and specifying the whole pipeline by declaring the sequence of predefined commands that will be applied. The framework supports various of them, including setting loss functions at different stages, selecting the layer number to conduct knowledge transfer into, freezing weights, and more.\n# B. Framework Features\n\u2022 Support for Any LLM-Generated Profiles: The framework seamlessly integrates LLM-generated user profiles, supporting outputs from any existing methodology. This allows us to experiment with and compare different methods for profile construction. \u2022 Flexible Experiment Configuration: A key feature of the framework is its highly flexible configuration system for defining experimental pipelines. These configurations\ntypically include standard RecBole setups (e.g., dataset splits for training, validation, and testing) and custom pipeline instructions. Users can define entire experiments by specifying sequences of predefined commands executed in order. Available commands include setting loss functions at various stages, selecting specific layers for knowledge transfer, freezing weights at chosen layers, and selecting subsets from the training dataset to transfer knowledge and finetune the CF model. \u2022 Batch Experiment Execution and Comparison: The framework enables users to run multiple experiments in batches, facilitating a more efficient and streamlined experimentation workflow. \u2022 Analytical Tools: Following the execution of experiments, the framework provides built-in tools for result analysis, allowing users to compare outcomes through visualizations and other analytical methods.\n# C. Internal Structure\nThe core of the framework is the Model Wrapper, which acts as an interface between the configuration and the underlying CF model. This wrapper manages key aspects of model manipulation through specialized components: \u2022 The Hook Manager provides access to the outputs of specific layers within the model, enabling detailed analysis and extraction of intermediate representations. \u2022 The Weights Manager controls the freezing and unfreezing of trainable parameters, making it easy to apply selective finetuning strategies. \u2022 The Loss Manager facilitates adding or removing custom losses, supporting advanced experimentation with different loss functions across various training stages. The framework also includes an execution module for the training and testing phases and a journaling system that logs experimental outcomes for subsequent evaluation.\n# IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nScenarios Under Analysis. We analyzed our method from two perspectives. First, we evaluated its applicability to traditional CF models that rely only on user-item interaction data, showing that our framework enhances these models by capturing nuanced relationships through LLM-generated profile reconstruction. Second, we examined its use with context-aware models, where current LLM knowledge transfer methods pass LLM-generated features as input. Datasets. We conducted experiments on two conventional datasets (Table I), namely, Amazon \u201cCD and Vinyl\u201d (CDs) and MovieLens (ML-1M). In all our experiments, we split the dataset into time-ordered training, validation, and test sets with ratios of 70-10- 20%, following previous studies [17], [18]. Baselines: To test the effectiveness of our approach, we selected three widely used neural CF baselines, each representing different architecture types: \u2022 NeuMF [19]: Neural matrix factorization. \u2022 SimpleX [20]: An efficient CF model using contrastive learning.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">TABLE I DATASET STATISTICS</div>\nDataset\nUsers\nItems\nInteractions Sparsity(%)\nML-1M\n6,041\n3,707\n1,000,209\n95.53\nCDs\n4,558\n7,784\n194,242\n99.45\n\u2022 MultVAE [21]: A model based on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). In the context-aware scenario, where models can leverage input features, we compared our approach to the state-ofthe-art knowledge transfer framework, KAR. The following baselines were selected for analysis: \u2022 DCN [22]: A cross network model. \u2022 DeepFM [23]: A neural model based on factorization machines. In all experiments, we ran at least N = 70 epochs of each baseline to ensure the absence of the grokking effect.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nWhen presenting the results in tables, we use the following notation: mark \u201cBase.\u201d is the baseline CF model, \u201cLLM-KT\u201d stands for the proposed training of the corresponding baseline with knowledge transfer, and \u201cKAR\u201d stands for the baseline model enhanced by KAR. We tested the proposed method on a reranking task for general CF models. We assessed performance by using ranking metrics such as NDCG@K, Hits@K, and Recall@K. Table II contains the main results for different baselines. Here, the proposed method consistently enhances the performance of all CF models across considered scenarios. We selected the conventional click-through-rate (CTR) prediction task [24] for context-aware models, which was evaluated using the AUC-ROC metric. The experimental results for the proposed method and KAR are shown in Table III. Our method demonstrates consistent performance with KAR. The proposed pretext task of internally reconstructing features proves competitive by explicitly providing them as inputs. Thus, the proposed knowledge transfer method performs comparably to existing ones but is more versatile, as it can be generalized to any CF model that does not support input features.\n# VI.

With flexible configuration options, LLM-KT empowers researchers and developers to incorporate LLM-generated features easily, pretraining CF models to harness these embeddings for enhanced performance. Our experiments on the MovieLens and Amazon datasets demonstrated that LLM-KT significantly improves the performance of the CF model in general and context-aware scenarios. Notably, the framework is competitive with stateof-the-art approaches such as KAR while offering broader applicability. These results validate the framework\u2019s potential for extending the capabilities of CF models through efficient LLM knowledge transfer. Future work will explore alternative architectures, focusing on sequential recommendations, and expand to other domains and datasets.\n# REFERENCES\n[1] Y. Koren, S. Rendle, and R.
