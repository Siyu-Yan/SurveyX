According to a survey conducted by Ponemon  institute, 2.32 million Americans have been victims to medical  data theft [1]. Damages occurring from medical data theft are  graver than other type of thefts, since in other types of thefts  like credit card or bank ATMs, the bank can be reported of the  theft and immediate actions are taken but in health data theft  fraud detection is rather tricky and slow. Heath data has  become a very tempting target for frauds due to a number of  reasons. One of the reasons being the easy access to health  data as compared to any other kind of financial data due to  lack of security provided in storing the data. Further this  information is used by the thieves for creating fraud credit  card accounts and file fake tax returns. This health information  can be misused to purchase drugs or medical equipments  illegally or even to claim false medical care. From past two  years, the highest number of hackings is suffered by health  industry. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, it  accounted for 43% of the total data breaches recorded [2]. And  most of the time the victims are not even aware of the theft.  Patient\u2019s privacy is first and foremost important issue which  must be addressed while switching to e-healthcare system.  Thus, a mechanism is required for proper access and retrieval  of heath data in a secure manner.   The number of healthcare records is increasing at an  exponential rate and it needs to be maintained in an efficient  manner. Each of the medical record comprises of many pages  comprising of text, images and graphs.  Thus, each of these  records is in unstructured and unencrypted form. The size of  these records is therefore becoming so large that the traditional  systems fail to handle and store it. Furthermore, processing of  these huge records is an issue. Also, reputed healthcare centers  have several branches and there is a need for global  accessibility of their medical records. Hence, Cloud  computing comes up as a viable solution in this scenario with  added advantage of providing these facilities in a scalable,  flexible and robust manner, along with location independent  access.   Modern technologies are being integrated to already  existing medical services. For example EMR (electronic  medical records) and EHR (electronic health records) are  those two technologies that have been adopted by some of the  medical healthcare centers to maintain health records. But \nthese technologies are susceptible to security threats by  hackers and employees of the center. Biometrics based data authentication provides an apt solution for providing security of health data stored in cloud. Biometric security can be obtained from different methods such as confidentiality,  integrity, non-repudiation and authentication as shown in fig. 1. Amongst which, authentication is a prime concern so that  any illegal access can be prohibited, thus we have focused on biometric authentication in this paper. There are many different biometric authentication mechanisms in practice but  biometric signatures are becoming more and more popular  because of its social acceptability. Biometric signatures are  different from conventional static signatures as static signature  verification is based on just the structural properties but  biometric signature authentication takes into account the  dynamic features of a signature such as velocity, acceleration,  total time, pen tilt angles, pen-ups and pen-downs which assures maximum security to the user.   Therefore, an amalgamation of biometrics and cloud can be thought of as an elixir for management of e-health records. In order to speedup processing of data and ensure a secure, scalable storage and management of data cloud computing has  been used in combination with biometric authentication  mechanism  for  storage  and  processing  purpose  in BAMHealthCloud. It makes use of parallel computing frameworks such as apache hadoop[3] for carrying out the authentication of data and artificial neural network for training  and processing of dynamic signature data. Furthermore, priority has also been taken into consideration for defining various levels of data access in order to safeguard high profile  clients against data theft which can set grounds for crimes  such as defamation of high profile patients through rumors,  baseless allegations and falsehood [4].   Thus, this paper proposes BAMHealthCloud and discusses various existing approaches for e- health data and presents a case study about management of health data in a developing  country. It suggests BAMHealthCloud as a solution for secure data access, retrieval and management. It has two modules namely health data management system and biometric  authentication agent. Following are the contributions of this  paper:  \uf0b7  Proposal of BAMHealthCloud which is a novel framework for biometric authentication of data in a healthcare cloud.  \uf0b7  Development of a priority based parallel algorithm \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/e8a6/e8a69a2e-4754-4d09-8307-e0e2f2c53e25.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 1: Different Levels of Biometric Security</div>\nALGOHealthSecurityCheck for providing a secure  access to data.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section II  gives the problem description followed by a survey of recent  literatures pertaining to health care data in section III. Section  IV discusses the case study and proposes BAMHealthCloud  framework followed by section V where authentication of  the user\u2019s access to data is elucidated.  Section VI validates  the proposed framework through rigorous experimentations  which are explained further by results. Finally the paper  concludes with the conclusion in section VII.  \n# II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION\n# A. HealthCare Cloud \nLet HC denote the health care cloud Hc={S, P, D, Sm} where  S denotes staff i.e. S = {S1, S2, S3, \u2026} where Si is the ith staff  member having access to health data stored in cloud, Pt  represents patients i.e. Pt = {Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, \u2026} where Pti is the  ith patient having access to only his or her record, D denotes  data store and Sm security manager. The problem lies in how S  and Pt interact with the entity D and how access to D is  restricted by the component Sm. \n# B. Data Management Problem \nHealth data usually contains records spanning across  hundreds of GB\u2019s of data. This data is usually difficult to  manage using traditional tools and techniques available at  disposal. Thus, we need a system that can handle such data  characterized by large volume and variety. In order to meet  this end the proposed technique uses health data management   system which has been built over cloud database management  system architecture [5]. \n# C. Biometric Security management problem \nThe data stored at a third party location is prone to intrusive  attacks, thus we need a management system to secure the  system from such attacks. The two main objectives are to  provide proper access to legitimate users and to authenticate  the users (patients and staffs). The authentication is provided  through the biometric authentication agent incorporated in the  system. This agent also provides access control to users, so  that no outsider or attacker is able to access the system with  malicious intentions. All the other symbols used and their  explanations is given in table 1. \n# III. LITERATURE SURVEY\nThe healthcare data is growing at an exponential rate, the sources being patient\u2019s individual records, data from clinical trials, radiology images and genomics sequences data. It is  estimated that this data will escalate to a value of 25,000 petabyte by 2020 [6]. Virtualization and cloud computing are\ntechnologies that are gaining popularity for capturing, manipulation and storage of data of large volume. Some of the  data management and processing platforms are Hadoop framework and Amazon Corporation EC2. Storing health  information in cloud involves its access by a remote desktop,  PDAs and mobile devices, but the access through such devices lead to a security issue. The work done in this paper focuses on health care data management through cloud and hadoop distributed programming framework. Furthermore, biometric  authentication is used for securing access to this data.  According to NIST [7] Cloud computing is defined as a  model of ubiquitous computing  which provides an on demand  access to a set of resources such as network, services and  storage in a flexible manner. Some of its benefits include  resource pooling, rapid elasticity and on demand services.  These are the features that have facilitated the use of cloud  computing in various domains including healthcare. Thrust areas of healthcare where cloud computing is becoming popular include DNA sequencing  using hadoop for parallel  execution of large DNA sequences without any compromise  on the accuracy [8]. Biomedical information sharing is another  area where cloud computing is gaining popularity for investigators to share data and information with each other but  involves risks like data loss and unauthorized access to data [9]. This work makes uses of hadoop for parallel execution in  order to achieve a high speed up and robust access to  resources along with overcoming the security issue by  employing an authentication element to it.  Biometric system can be used for providing authentication  in a scenario such as healthcare data storage and retrieval. The  main requirement of implementing biometric in healthcare  sector is the need for privacy and confidentiality of patient\u2019s\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">TABLE I  SYMBOLS AND NOTATIONS </div>\nSymbols \nExplanations \n\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc24 \nInput signature sample, representing kth \nsample of jth user \nOd \nOutput data after performing \nMapReduce on Input data \nCov \nThe covariance matrix obtained after \nperforming  Sigcovariance function \ns \nSquare root of the diagonal elements of \nthe covariance matrix \nCor \nCorrelation \nmatrix \nobtained \nfrom \ncovariance matrix  and product of \nsquare root matrix \nPcacoef \nThe matrix representing the PCA \ncoefficients \nTloc \nThe local trained network \n\u0424 \nNULL \n\u222a \nUnion \nTNet \nConsolidated trained network \nErr \nError of the network \nLoc \nNumber of local networks \n \nrecords. There are some international regulations like HIPAA  (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) [10], the  Australian Privacy Principles Act and the European Data  Protection Directive that demand high level of security, access  control, and exchange of sensitive data. Biometric based  technology provides a secured method to perform access  control and individual identification as compared to other  traditional technologies. It is very difficult to reproduce  biometric features and therefore it can be used to easily  identify an individual.  In [11], authors have used bimodal approach for providing  security for electronic medical record, this bimodal approach  combines voice recognition and signature authentication  technologies. Multi-biometric system integrated with cloud  can also provide  security for healthcare data [12]. The data in  this case is stored in UBUNTU Enterprise Cloud Eucalyptus  Database (UEC). In [13] a semi continuous  authentication  mechanism has been designed for authentication of a layered  health monitor framework. It is aimed at reducing misuse of  data stored in a heterogeneous cloud system. It uses a fusion  of behavioral and physiological biometric i.e. keystroke and  face recognition. In BAMHealthCloud, the behavioral as well  as the structural characteristics of a person\u2019s signature is taken  for performing authentication. Furthermore, signatures are  highly socially acceptable means of individual authentication.  A cloud based approach is used to implement signature based  authentication system in order to decrease the running time,  and hence BAMHealthCloud achieves high accuracy along  with high speedup.   Hence, we have used signature biometric for security of  health data stored in cloud. This is the novelty of our paper  that we have used behavioral biometric technique like  signature which has not been used in the recent literature. It  provides minimum error rate and is socially acceptable.  Integrating biometric with cloud provides high levels of  security which is fast, globally accessible, scalable and robust.  In addition, the health care staffs are using hand held devices  such as mobile phones, tablets, PDAs to access the records of  patients. Using signature biometric amalgamated with cloud  technology and integrated with handheld devices would be a  foolproof security system for data access and retrieval without  any extra hardware cost. \nIn a developing country like India with the population mark reaching second highest in the world. Health is an issue of prime concern as the individuals are the nations building  forces. The capital city itself has a population of  approximately 1780 lakh [14]. Lakhs of patients visit healthcare centers and corresponding to each patient a record  is maintained. According to department of health and family  welfare, the department has to cater to the needs of  approximately 160 lakh [15] people plus migratory and floating population from neighboring states. With the  evolution of digital era a digital copy is kept and since the  numbers of patients escalate on a daily basis therefore this has lead to huge volumes of healthcare records. Therefore, it\u2019s the  need of the hour to handle such voluminous records.  \n REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) < \nPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) <\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/7ad5/7ad5df55-7c85-4837-be5d-b4e9f4100b2b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig.2: BAMHealthCloud- Cloud based secure biometric architecture</div>\n  There have been many cases reported in past where healthcare data theft has been performed by employees such as a husband and wife team stole data of 80 patients from Manhattans Lenox Hill Hospital worth more than 14,00000 USD. In another incident a former employee stole fact sheets of 450 patients which can be used for committing medical fraud, tax fraud and health insurance fraud [16].  In this case study, we propose a cloud based solution for handling such huge number of records, the data arising from different health care sources is offloaded to a third party cloud i.e. the proposed healthcare cloud as shown by Fig. 2. The storage and retrieval of this data is handled by the healthcare cloud. The healthcare cloud consists of two components health data store and security manager. The health data store is based on health data management system and security is handled by the biometric authentication agent on behalf of the security manager. The relationship between the different modules is given by Fig. 3. Health data store and security manager are overlapping entities which belongs to the Health Care cloud. The data that is to be secured is stored in Health Data Store and the security manager uses biometric authentication agent for providing the security on cloud. \nThis component of the healthcare cloud is responsible for  management of patients report and other information. It is  composed of three layers namely client level, health service \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4d16/4d16843c-8b33-466a-9a36-32777a911968.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 3. Relationship between modules of BAMHealthCloud</div>\nprovider level and data center level. The health service  provider level is further divided into administrative and  security level. Biometric authentication agent acts at the  security level. Client level provides an interaction interface  between the cloud data and its users. The security and resource  provisioning is in turn handled by the two components of  health service provider level respectively. The data storage  and its management is the responsibility of the data center  level. Thus, the Health Data Management System is  responsible for overall management, storage and retrieval of  the healthcare data. \n# B. Biometric authentication agent\nThis module uses biometric signatures for the purpose of  authentication. The dynamic features of a signature is captured  using a digitizing tablet which records features like x, y  coordinates, velocity of the pen, total time taken to sign,  angles of pen while signing, number of pen ups and pendowns, acceleration etc. After the signature is captured its  important features are extracted and then it is preprocessed  and stored as a template. After this phase, this template is used  for training the data and then these trained networks are stored  in cloud. During verification phase, the user\u2019s signature is  checked against the stored database and it is found out  whether the user is genuine or forged.   Moreover, another added advantage of this approach is that  the processing is also done on cloud. This saves on the storage  and cost along with providing lesser carbon footprints i.e. it\u2019s  an energy efficient approach as it makes use of mobile and  handheld devices like tablets and phones for access purpose.   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">V.

The proposed approach is divided into two phases: Phase IEnrollment phase and Phase II authentication phase \n# A. Phase I-Enrollment phase \nIn this phase, as shown in Fig. 4, the staff and the patients  enrolled in the health care centre are asked to enroll  themselves by giving their signature samples using either the  signature capturing device or their smart phones that are  installed with the signature capturing software. Once a user\u2019s  signature is captured, the quality of the given signature is  checked using SigQuality checker software. The function of  this software is to ensure that the recorded signature samples  match up to the quality standards required for authentication.   Once this match is performed, the features of the samples are  extracted and are stored in the healthcare cloud. \n# B. Phase II authentication phase \nIn this phase as described in Fig. 5, user is checked for his  authenticity. The user is asked to give his signature, which is  sent for quality check and after that, its features are extracted.  Then, this signature sample is checked against the stored user  template in the healthcare cloud. This matching is performed using resilient backpropagation algorithm in a feedforward\nnetwork (explained later). The matching process is  n order to find out whether the user is a genuine one or  his user authentication is done in a parallelized way.

Higher the priority value associated with the user more is the  level of security guaranteed by the system. This is taken care  of by associating a threshold value in the training algorithm   i.e. algorithm 1 that depends upon the priority P. According to  this algorithm authentication is performed based on the  associated priority value. If a user with low priority i.e. a  regular staff member accesses the data then its authentication  performed with its threshold value set to Priority_Low (lines 14). Similarly, the threshold values are set as Priority_Avg,                      Fig. 4.Authentication Phase   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4cbd/4cbd2a92-1689-46b0-976b-a0e0bf1f4e68.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"> et al. 2014 Bhattasali et al. 2014 Krawczyk & Jain 2</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Bhattasali et al. 2014 Krawczyk & Jain 2005</div>\ny and specificity of BAMHealthCloud versus approaches used in literatu\nPriority_High and Priority_VHigh for privileged staff, privileged patients and VIP patients respectively.  Authentication of the health data based on the priority as  threshold  value  is  done  by  algorithm  2  i.e. ALGOHealthAuthentication. In steps 2 to 6, the signature samples are read. This read is performed in a parallel fashion.  Idjk  is the input signature sample matrix which represents the  kth samples of jth user. After this mapreduce function is applied  for calculating the covariance on the input data sample. The usage of mapreduce framework ensures that all the processing  of data is done in a parallelized approach on commodity  hardware across a distributed cluster. This speeds up the processing and is cost effective along with being fault tolerant. \n> REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) <   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/343f/343f2d50-a259-4fa8-b2af-12a576b409b8.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/caa5/caa5a48b-7fa4-458b-9563-4eacc01d3c37.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Number of Iterations</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 7: Running time of BAMHealthCloud versus approaches used in </div>\nIn step 11, the PCA feature extraction is performed on the  input data. After this, training of dataset is done using resilient  backpropagation algorithm in a parallelized manner.  Resilient backpropogation (RPROP) is a popular algorithm for  backprpogation  training of multilayer feed-forward neural  netwoks. Backpropogation algorithm involves application of  chain rule repeatedly to findout the impact of each weight in  accordance to error function E [17].   \u2202E t  \u2202\u03c9ij =  \u2202E \u2202si.  \u2202si \u2202net i. \u2202net i \u2202wij                                                               (1)      \n(1)\nwhere, \u03c9ij is the weight from neuron j to neuron i. si is the output and neti is the sum of inputs of neurons i. \n (2)\nRPROP solves the problem of \"vanishing gradients\",  according to which with increase in depth and complexity of  an artificial neural network, the gradient propagates  backwards  by  stochastic  gradient  descent  (SGD)  backpropogation becomes increasingly smaller which leads to  negligible updates in weight along with slow training [18]  [17].  It achieves this by using a fixed update value \u03b4ij  whose  value can be increased or decreased with each iteration \u03b7+ and  \u03b7-  multiplicativley. where, \u03b7  is an asymmetric factor. The  increase or decrease in values depends on the change in sign  of gardient with respect to weight \u03c9ij It converges to a local  minima but is able to skip through flat surfaces fast due to \u03b7+  multiplicative factor. Algorithm 3 shows the pseudocode of  Resilient backpropogation algorithm [18]. Here, \u2206ij is the  update value for each weight i.e. the size of weight update.  \u2206max and \u2206min are the maximum and minimum change and \u2206wij  is the change in weights.   Local networks (Tloc) are created using netcreate () function  and then these local networks are combined to form a  consolidated  network  of  local  networks  (TNet).This  consolidated network is the output of the algorithm.  Definition  1:  netcreate  function  implements  Resilient  backpropagation algorithm on a feed forward network in a  distributed manner and this distribution is done based on the size  of the dataset being used.  Definition 2: Sigtrain is the function which takes input and target  matrices and trains a network based on the architecture of a local  network which was created using Resilient backpropagation  algorithm. \nBAMHealthCloud Khan et al. 2014 Krawczyk & Jain 2005 Bhattasali et al. 20142\nTheorem 1: The time complexity of ALGOHealthSecurityCheck is  O(L xM).  Proof: The time complexity for performing security check  on health data stored on cloud is O (L x M). It takes O (L x M)  for performing security check on low priority users (line 4,  ALGORITHM 1) as given in theorem 2. It takes O (L x M) for  performing security check on average priority users (line 8,  ALGORITHM 1). It takes O (L x M) for performing security  check on high priority users (line 12, ALGORITHM 1) and  takes O (L x M) for performing security check on very high  priority users (line 16, ALGORITHM 1).Thus, the complexity  of ALGOHealthSecurityCheck is maximum (O (L x M), O (L  x M), O (L x M), O (L x M)) i.e. O (L x M)  Theorem 2: The time complexity of ALGOHealthAuthentication is  O (L x M) where L is the number of users and M is the number of  signature samples corresponding to each user.

Experimental Setup \n1) System setup  An 8 cabinet cluster with 397 nodes was taken for carrying  out experimentations of BAMHealthCloud. Each node had  12 cores and hence, the total number of cores was 4764  (397x 12). The total memory available per node was 64 GB  and therefore, the total memory available was 768GB (12x  64). The experimental data that were used are real  handwritten signature data that were collected through  handheld devices.  2) Dataset Used  Different handheld devices such as Smart phones, tablets,  phablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs) were used for  acquiring data. The signature samples were collected from  9000 users. The users involved both the staff and patients. The  data has been recorded in five temporal sessions separated  over a period of one week per 1500 users. The data collected  comprised of 2000 staff members and 7000 patients. 40  samples were collected from each user, 25 were genuine and  15 samples were forged. Therefore, the total number of  samples stored was 360000.  In order to comply to the ethics involved with collection of  such significant and critical information, the participants  consent was taken on the clause that their identity will be kept  anonymous. The participants were only identified as either  staff or patients, apart from this all the personal information  were kept anonymous.  Table III shows the features that have been recorded while  capturing signatures [19].  The features include Acceleration,  Magnetic Field, Orientation and Angular Velocity which were  recorded while capturing signatures.  3) Data Preparation and  Processing  In order to prepare data for training purpose, the raw data  was firstly preprocessed by using hadoop framework. The data  was first imported into hadoop distribuited file system and was  then reduced using Principal component analysis (PCA) [20]  technique. MapReduce code for PCA was executed in order to  carry out all the computations in a parallel manner. It should  be noted that since the dataset used was very large, the  processing involved multiple mapper functions spanning  across several nodes of the cluster. Hadoop2.x which is the  latest version has been utilized in our experimentations. The  replication factor of 3 which was adopted ensured that our  system is robust against any node failures. Furthermore,  robustness was also ensured through speculative execution  property of hadoop cluster.   B. Evaluation metrics \n# B.

The speedup according to  Amdahl\u2019s  law  [21]  is  given  by  equation  6. \n (6)\nWhere P is the number of processors, S (P) is the speedup  achieved while running computation on P processors, T (1)  is the running time on a single processor and T (P) is the  running time on P processors. \n# C. Results\nIn order to validate the authenticity of BAMHealthCloud,  experiments  have  been  performed.  The  results  of  BAMHealthCloud have been compared to the other  approaches that have been used in recent literature and are  summarized in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Fig. 6 shows the results in  terms of Equal Error Rate (EER), sensitivity and specificity,  while Fig. 7 shows the plot of running times of the different  approaches.  From Fig. 6, we can see that results obtained from the  proposed framework are better than the other compared  approaches in literature. BAMHealthCloud achieves an EER  of 0.12 which is better than the rest of the approaches used.  The sensitivity of the proposed system is 0.98 and the  specificity is 0.95 which is again better than the existing  approaches implemented in literature.  In order to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed  approach, the running time of BAMHealthCloud has been  calculated along with running time of other sequential  approaches proposed in [12], [13] and [11] as shown in Fig.7.  The experiments have been conducted rigorously 15 times and  from the results it can be concluded that BAMHealthCloud  took lesser time to run than these approaches. The results  furthermore, show that a speedup of 9x was achieved by  BAMHealthCloud using equation 6.  With the achieved results showing EER of 0.12, sensitivity  of 0.98, specificity of 0.95 and speed up of 9x, it can be  inferred that BAMHealthCloud outperforms all the other  methods that have been used in healthcare sectors. Moreover,  this approach can be successfully deployed for securing health  data in real life. \n# VII. CONCLUSION \nIn order to handle ever growing data of health sectors and to  provide security to different users and staff involved, a cloud  based biometric authentication system BAMHealthCloud has  been proposed in this paper. This model is developed after \nperforming a detailed case study on a healthcare centre in a  developing country. This model has two different components,  one component takes care of the management of the huge data  that is being generated on a daily basis and other one takes  care of the security aspect. ALGOHealthSecurityCheck has been proposed in this work which performs security check  using parallelized MapReduce programming model. The use  of this model ensures the scalability, flexibility and robustness  of the system. Experiments performed on this system reveal that BAMHealthCloud achieves a speedup of 9x which is  better than other systems implemented in recent works. Priority  based  system  has  been  incorporated  in  BAMHealthCloud which results in fast fetching and  processing of crucial records. The system achieves an EER of  0.12, sensitivity of 0.98 and specificity of 0.95 which is  comparable to other approaches existing in literature.  BAMHealthCloud can be successfully deployed in other  sectors as well such as defense, banking sector, organizations,  and educational sectors. It is well suited for applications of  any size as it offers horizontal scaling of resources and thus is  suitable for big data processing.   \n# ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis is to acknowledge that Farhana Javed Zareen is the  corresponding  author of  this  paper.
