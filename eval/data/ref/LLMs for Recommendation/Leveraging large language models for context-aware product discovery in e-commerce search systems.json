The rapid growth of e-commerce has led to increased online products, making practical and helpful research very important to users [1]. Products and businesses. Ecommerce search engines play an essential role in the customer and product catalog, playing an important role in\n\nfacilitating product discovery and driving sales [2].\nAdvances in data retrieval techniques, machine learning al\ngorithms, and user experience design have marked the evolution of e-commerce search engines. Traditional methods are often used by comparing keywords and ranking criteria. These systems usually struggle to deal with the complexity of user queries, product diversity, and the nuances of purchasing [3]. As e-commerce businesses have expanded their product and user base, the limitations of research models have become apparent, requiring more sophisticated solutions.\nRecent years have seen a shift towards more intelligent and\nmore content-aware searches. This advanced system uses user behavior, product metadata, and real-time reporting data to deliver more personalized search results. And they are affected [4]. The integration of machine learning techniques and intense learning models has improved the ability of research to understand user intent and match it with those necessary goods.\n\n# 1.2. Challenges in Product Discovery\n\nDespite the progress in e-commerce search, product discov\nery is still a challenging task without problems. One of the main problems is the \"cold start\" problem, where new users or products do not have enough historical data for recommendations [5]. This problem is especially acute in an e-commerce environment with rapid changes and many user preferences.\nAnother critical challenge is the difference between user\nquestions and product descriptions. Users often express their needs in natural language, which may not be directly related to the metadata process used to describe the product [6]. This inconsistency can lead to poor research results and user frustration, potentially affecting conversions and customer satisfaction.\nThe sheer size and diversity of product catalogs in today's\ne-commerce industry create additional challenges. Search engines must optimize and process millions of products in realtime, considering many factors such as relevance, popularity, value, and user preferences. Measuring goals often conflicts when managing the system performance is a non-trivial task [7].\nIn addition, the positive nature of the e-commerce environ\nment reflects the physical problems. User preferences, product trends, and business conditions can change quickly, requiring search engines to adapt rapidly to maintain accuracy and efficiency [8].\n\n# 1.3. Role of Large Language Models in E-com\nmerce\n\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs) has\nopened up new possibilities to solve problems in e-commerce research and product discovery. This model, trained on a large number of data sets, shows a remarkable ability in the understanding of language and generation. In the context of e\n\ncommerce, LLMs offer many advantages for developing research [9].\nLLMs can improve query comprehension by capturing the\nsemantic nuances and intent behind user queries. Their ability to process and interpret natural language allows for a more incredible combination of user queries and product descriptions, reflecting different languages ?? that often plague search engines.\nIn addition, LLMs can be used for detailed questions and\nmodifications, enabling users to ask essential questions with context and context. This ability can help influence products that may not directly answer the user's initial question but follow their goals. The creative capabilities of LLMs also present opportunities to improve product descriptions and create dynamic content based on user preferences [10]. This can increase engagement and search results, improving user engagement and conversion rates.\n1.4. Importance of Context-Awareness in Search Content awareness has emerged as an essential factor in im\nproving the relevance and effectiveness of e-commerce search engines. Content includes many factors, including user demographics, browsing history, current behavior, time of day, location, and other factors such as weather or current situation [11].\nIntegrating content data into search algorithms allows for\nmore personalization and product recommendations. By understanding the user's current context, search engines can prioritize products that will meet the user's immediate needs and preferences. This understanding of content can improve the user experience, leading to greater engagement and potential purchase [12].\nContent recognition also plays a vital role in solving the\ncold start problem by providing additional signals to new users or products. Although there is no comprehensive history, information about the subject can guide the search for further recommendations.\n\n# 2. Literature Review\n\n# 2.1. Traditional E-commerce Search Systems\n\nTraditional e-commerce research often relies on content\nbased competition and competitive rankings. These systems usually use data retrieval standards such as TF-IDF (Time-Inverse Document Frequency) and BM25 to evaluate products based on their textual similarity to user languages. Ask while these methods have become the basis of e-commerce research, they often struggle with the complexity of natural queries and product relationships [13].\nCollaborative and content-based filtering are widely used in\nthe recommendation process for e-commerce. Collaborative\n\nfiltering leverages user interactions to identify patterns and make recommendations based on similar user behavior. Content-based filtering, on the other hand, focuses on product characteristics and user preferences to generate recommendations [14]. While applicable in some situations, these methods often face problems such as the initial cooling problem and the ability to capture the details of the subject.\nThe limitations of traditional research to handle the differ\nences between users' questions and descriptions of products have led to the search for advanced techniques. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) have revealed semantic patterns in the text, improving the matching of questions and objects [15]. In addition, I am learning to rank results, including various factors and machine learning algorithms to improve search results.\n\n# 2.2. Context-Aware Recommender Systems\n\nContext-aware recommender systems (CARS) have\nemerged as a significant advance in personalized recommendation strategies. This system aims to incorporate contextual information in the recommendation process, recognizing that user preferences and relevant products can vary greatly depending on the context [18]. In e-commerce, context can include factors such as time, location, user's current activity, and mood.\nSeveral methods have been proposed for integrating the\ncontent in the proposal. Pre-filtering, post-filtering, and contextual modeling are good techniques. Pre-filtering involves selecting relevant data based on content before applying traditional recommendations [19]. Post-filtering uses content-based selection after generating recommendations. Contextual modeling considered the most straightforward method, directly incorporates contextual information into algorithm recommendations.\nTensor factorization has proven to be a powerful technique\nfor modeling large amounts of data in context-aware propositions. This approach extends the matrix factorization process to higher-order tensors, allowing the modeling of users, objects, and multiple variables [20]. Tensor factorization leads to the capture of the interaction between these entities, which leads to more accurate and meaningful content.\n\n# 2.3. Large Language Models in Information Re\ntrieval\n\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs) has rev\nolutionized many aspects of natural language processing, including information retrieval. These models, trained extensively on text, have demonstrated excellent capabilities in understanding and producing human-like text [21]. LLMs provide solutions to long-standing problems in data retrieval, such as understanding questions, comparisons, and fact-checking.\nRecent research has explored the application of LLMs in\n\nvarious IR tasks. Query expansion techniques leveraging LLMs have shown promise in enriching user queries with relevant terms, potentially bridging the vocabulary gap between queries and documents [22]. The ability of LLMs to generate coherent and contextually relevant text has also been exploited for document summarization and snippet generation, enhancing the presentation of search results.\nIn e-commerce search, LLMs have been investigated for\ntheir potential to improve product description understanding and query-product matching. The rich semantic representations learned by these models can capture nuanced relationships between products, potentially leading to more diverse and relevant search results [23].\n\n# 4. Personalization Techniques in E-commerc\n\nPersonalization has become essential in e-commerce to tai\nlor products to customers' preferences and needs. Many methods have been developed to complete personalization in ecommerce search and approval.\nUser profiling is an essential part of personalization, with\nthe construction of detailed user profiles based on interaction history, demographic data, and behavioral data. pwm. These profiles form the basis for personalized search results and product recommendations. Collaborative filtering has continued integrating customer data, resulting in more accurate and personalized recommendations.\nSession-based approval strategies have received attention\nfor their ability to capture short-term and demanding users. This system focuses on the user's current session, changing recommendations in real time based on the sequence of user actions. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and monitoring techniques have been successfully used to model consumer behavior in e-commerce [24].\n\n# 2.5. Tensor Factorization for Context Mode\n\nTensor factorization has emerged as a powerful technique\nfor modeling large amounts of data in context-aware propositions. This approach extends the matrix factorization process to higher-order tensors, allowing the modeling of users, objects, and multiple variables.\nCANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decomposi\ntion are prominent tensor factorization techniques used in context modeling. CP decomposition expresses a tensor as the sum of rank-one tensors, while Tucker decomposition decomposes a tensor into a core tensor multiplied by matrices along each mode [25]. This process allows for the capture of interactions between users, products, and the content of the content, which leads to more accurate and recommended content.\nRecent research has explored extensions and improvements\nto tensor factorization for a context-aware recommendation. A Bayesian probabilistic tensor factorization model was\n\nproposed to deal with uncertainty and variability in the data. In addition, deep learning is combined with tensor factorization to learn more about users, objects, and context.\n\n# 3. Methodology\n\n# 3.1. System Architecture Overview\n\nThe proposed context-aware product discovery system lev\nerages large language models to enhance the e-commerce search experience. The architecture comprises several interconnected modules, each designed to address specific aspects of the search process [26]. Table 1 presents an overview of the system components and their primary functions.\nTable 1: System Components and Functions\n\nComponent \nPrimary Function \nQuery Processor \nParses and preprocesses user queries \nContext Extractor \nCaptures and represents contextual \ninformation \nLLM Integration \nModule \nInterfaces with the large language \nmodel \nQuery Expansion \nEngine \nEnriches queries with relevant terms. \nRanking Module \nScores and ranks products based on \nrelevance \nPersonalization \nEngine \nTailors result in individual user \npreferences. \nComponent\n\nThe system employs a modular design, allowing for flexi\nbility and scalability. Data flows between components through standardized interfaces, enabling efficient processing and real-time response capabilities.\nFigure 1: System Architecture Diagram\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/2768/2768994d-c736-477b-8604-98d372c70199.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\nThe system architecture diagram illustrates the interconnec\ntions between various components of the proposed contextaware product discovery system. The diagram depicts a multilayered structure, with the user interface at the top, followed by the query processing layer, context extraction layer, LLM integration layer, and data storage layer at the bottom. Arrows indicate the flow of information between components, highlighting the iterative nature of the search process. The LLM integration module is centrally positioned, emphasizing its role in enhancing various aspects of the search pipeline.\n\n# 3.2. Large Language Model Integration\n\nIntegrating large language models (LLMs) into the e-com\nmerce search system is a crucial innovation of this research. We use a pre-trained transformer-based model that is finetuned on domain-specific e-commerce data to enhance its performance in product-related tasks [27]. Table 2 outlines the specifications of the LLM employed in our system.\nTable 2: Large Language Model Specifications\n\nParameter \nValue \nModel Architecture \nTransformer-based \nNumber of Parameters \n1.5 billion \nTraining Corpus Size \n500 GB of e-commerce text \nFine-tuning Dataset \n10 million product descriptions \n3 \nParameter \nValue \nModel Architecture \nTransformer-based \nNumber of Parameters \n1.5 billion \nTraining Corpus Size \n500 GB of e-commerce text \nFine-tuning Dataset \n10 million product descriptions \nParameter\n\nParameter\n\n500 GB of e-commerce text\n\n10 million product descriptions\n\nInput Sequence Length\n\nOutput Sequence Length 128\n\nOutput Sequence Length\n\nThe LLM is integrated into multiple stages of the search\nprocess, including query understanding, context interpretation, and product description enrichment. A custom API facilitates efficient communication between the LLM and other system components, ensuring low-latency responses.\n\n# 3.3. Context Extraction and Representation\n\nContext extraction is crucial for delivering personalized and\nrelevant search results. Our system employs a multi-faceted approach to capture and represent contextual information. Table 3 presents the various contextual features considered in our model.\nTable 3: Contextual Features\n\nFeature Category \nExamples \nUser Demographics \nAge, Gender, Location \nSession Behavior \nClick-through Rate, Dwell Time \nHistorical Interactions \nPast Purchases, Product Views \nTemporal Factors \nTime of Day, Day of Week, Season \nDevice Information \nMobile/Desktop, Screen Size \nExternal Factors \nWeather, Local Events \nWeather, Local Events\n\nExternal Factors\n\nTo efficiently represent this diverse contextual information,\nwe employ a tensor-based approach. Each contextual feature is encoded as a dimension in a high-dimensional tensor, allowing for complex interactions to be captured.\nFigure 2: Context Tensor Representation\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/729f/729f44f5-43de-4ab3-b20e-b9b97cc5b0a1.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nThe context tensor representation visualization demon\nstrates the multi-dimensional nature of the contextual data in our system. The figure shows a 3D tensor structure, with each slice representing a different contextual dimension. Color gradients within each slice indicate the intensity or relevance of specific contextual features. The intersections of these slices highlight the potential for capturing complex interactions between different contextual factors, which is crucial for accurate personalization in e-commerce search.\n\n# 3.4. Query Understanding and Expansion\n\nQuery understanding is enhanced through the application of\nthe integrated LLM. The model processes raw user queries, extracting intent, identifying key concepts, and resolving ambiguities [28]. This deep semantic understanding forms the basis for subsequent query expansion.\nThe query expansion process leverages the LLM's\nknowledge to enrich the original query with relevant terms and concepts. This expansion is context-aware, considering the user's current context as represented in the contextual tensor. Table 4 illustrates the query expansion process with sample inputs and outputs.\nTable 4: Query Expansion Examples\n\nOriginal \nQuery \nContextual \nFactors \nExpanded Query \nred dress \nSummer, \nEvening Event \nred dress summer evening \ngown cocktail party \nlaptop \nStudent, Budget-\nconscious \nlaptop student budget \naffordable, lightweight \nrunning \nMale, Marathon \nrunning shoe men \nmarathon training high mileage\n\nThe expanded queries provide a richer semantic representa\ntion of the user's intent, potentially improving the retrieval of relevant products.\n\n# 3.5. Ranking and Personalization Algorithms\n\nThe ranking module combines multiple signals to score and\norder products in response to a given query. We employ a learning-to-rank approach, integrating traditional IR features with deep learning-based semantic matching scores. The ranking model is trained on historical click-through data, optimizing for relevance and user engagement metrics.\nPersonalization is achieved through a hybrid approach,\ncombining collaborative filtering techniques with the contextaware representations generated by our system. We utilize a tensor factorization method to model the interactions between users, items, and contextual factors.\nFigure 3: Personalized Ranking Model\n\nThe personalized ranking model visualization depicts the\ncomplex interplay of various factors in determining the final product ranking. The figure shows a multi-layer neural network structure, with input layers representing query features, product features, and user context. Intermediate layers illustrate the feature interaction and transformation processes, while the output layer represents the final relevance scores. Attention mechanisms are visualized as heat maps overlaying the network structure, indicating the varying importance of different features for specific queries or contexts. This visualization underscores the sophisticated nature of the ranking algorithm, which integrates multiple data sources and machinelearning techniques to produce highly personalized search results.\nThe performance of our ranking and personalization algo\nrithms is evaluated using standard IR metrics, including Mean Average Precision (MAP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Click-Through Rate (CTR). Table 5 presents a comparison of our proposed method against baseline approaches.\nTable 5: Ranking Performance Comparison\n\nMethod \nMAP \nNDCG@10 \nCTR \nBM25 Baseline \n0.342 \n0.401 \n2.1% \nLambdaMART \n0.389 \n0.456 \n2.8% \nBERT-based Ranker \n0.415 \n0.483 \n3.2% \nProposed Method \n0.457 \n0.521 \n3.9% \nProposed Method\n\nThe results demonstrate significant improvements in rank\ning performance across all metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of our context-aware, LLM-enhanced approach to product discovery in e-commerce search systems.\n\n# 4. Experimental Design and Implementa\ntion\n\n# 4.1. Dataset Description and Preparation\n\nTo evaluate the performance of our proposed context-aware\nproduct discovery system, we utilized a large-scale e-commerce dataset collected from a significant online retail platform. The dataset encompasses various product categories, user interactions, and contextual information [29]. Table 6 provides an overview of the dataset statistics.\nTable 6: Dataset Statistics\n\nAttribute \nValue \nNumber of Users \n1,225,173 \nNumber of Products \n3,782,951 \nNumber of Interactions \n47,893,215 \nTimespan \nJanuary 2021 - December \n2022 \nNumber of Product \nCategories \n1,287 \nContextual Features \n32 \nThe dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, re-\nTimespan\n\nNumber of Product Categories\n\nThe dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, re\nmove duplicates, and normalize feature scales. We employed a temporal split strategy for train-test separation, using the\n\nfirst 80% of the data chronologically for training and the remaining 20% for testing. This approach simulates real-world scenarios where models are trained on historical data and evaluated on future interactions.\nFigure 4: Dataset Distribution Visualization\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/deb5/deb5e85e-f08d-4511-a6c9-5a49fa5fabe4.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nThe dataset distribution visualization illustrates the com\nplex nature of the e-commerce data used in our study. The figure presents a multi-faceted view of the dataset, including histograms of user activity levels, product popularity distributions, and interaction density across different product categories. A heatmap showcases the temporal patterns of user interactions, revealing daily and seasonal trends. Additionally, a network graph depicts the relationships between product categories based on co-occurrence in user interactions, with node sizes representing category sizes and edge thicknesses indicating the strength of relationships.\n\n# 4.2. Evaluation Metrics\n\nTo comprehensively assess the performance of our context\naware product discovery system, we employed a diverse set of evaluation metrics. These metrics capture various aspects of system performance, including relevance, ranking quality, and user engagement [29]. Table 7 presents the evaluation metrics used in our experiments.\nTable 7: Evaluation Metrics\n\nTable 7: Evaluation Metrics \nMetric \nDescription \nFormula \nMean Average \nPrecision (MAP) \nMeasures the \nquality of ranked \nlists \nMAP = \u03a3(AP) / \nN \nMean Average Precision (MAP)\n\nNormalized \nDiscounted \nCumulative Gain \n(NDCG) \nEvaluates the \nusefulness of \nranked lists \nNDCG = DCG / \nIDCG \nMean Reciprocal \nRank (MRR) \nAssesses the \nposition of the first \nrelevant item \nMRR = 1 / rank \nClick-Through \nRate (CTR) \nMeasures user \nengagement with \nsearch results \nCTR = (Clicks / \nImpressions) * \n100 \nConversion Rate \n(CR) \nEvaluate the \neffectiveness in \ndriving purchases \nCR = (Purchases \n/ Sessions) * 100 \nThese metrics were calculated at various cut-off points (e.g.,\nNDCG@5, NDCG@10) to view system performance across different result list lengths comprehensively.\n\n# 4.3. Baseline Models and Comparisons\n\nTo benchmark the performance of our proposed system, we\nimplemented and compared it against several state-of-the-art baseline models. These baselines represent different e-commerce search and recommendation approaches, ranging from traditional information retrieval methods to advanced deep learning models [30]. Table 8 outlines the baseline models used in our comparative analysis.\nTable 8: Baseline Models\n\nModel \nDescription \nBM25 \nThe classic probabilistic retrieval \nfunction \nCollaborative \nFiltering \nUser-based and item-based CF \napproaches \nMatrix Factorization \nLatent factor model for user-item \ninteractions \nBERT-based Ranker \nFine-tuned BERT model for product \nranking \nLatent factor model for user-item interactions\n\nFine-tuned BERT model for product ranking\n\nBERT-based Ranker\n\nCombines memorization and generalization\n\nWide & Deep\n\n# Deep Learning Context-aware model\n\nDeep Learning Context-aware model\n\nEach baseline model was implemented and optimized fol\nlowing the best practices described in their respective publications. We ensured fair comparison using the same dataset splits and evaluation metrics across all models.\n\n# 4.4. Model Training and Optimization\n\nThe training process for our context-aware product discov\nery system involved several stages, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter optimization. We employed a distributed training framework to handle the large-scale dataset efficiently [31].\nThe significant language model component was fine-tuned\non a subset of product descriptions and user queries to adapt it to the e-commerce domain. The fine-tuning process utilized a combination of masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction tasks, with a learning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 32.\nWe employed a gradient-boosting framework with a learn\ning rate of 0.01 and a maximum tree depth of 8 for the ranking and personalization components. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian optimization with a budget of 200 trials. Table 9 presents the optimal hyperparameters found for our model.\nTable 9: Optimal Hyperparameters\n\n \nHyperparameter \nValue \nLearning Rate \n0.008 \nNumber of Trees \n1500 \nMax Tree Depth \n10 \nL2 Regularization \n0.1 \nFeature Sampling Rate \n0.8 \nDropout Rate \n0.3 \nFigure 5: Training Convergence Plot \nHyperparameter\n\nFigure 5: Training Convergence Plot\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/29ac/29ac9162-8424-4355-a863-c5285b6b8ac3.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nThe training convergence plot visualizes the learning pro\ngress of our context-aware product discovery model over training iterations. The figure displays multiple curves representing performance metrics (e.g., loss, MAP, NDCG) on both training and validation sets. The x-axis represents training iterations, while the y-axis shows the metric values. The plot demonstrates the model's convergence behavior, with the training and validation curves gradually approaching optimal performance levels. Annotations highlight critical points in the training process, such as early stopping triggers and learning rate adjustments.\n\n# 4.5. Ablation Studies\n\nWe conducted a series of ablation studies to understand the\ncontribution of individual components and features to the overall system performance. These experiments involved systematically removing or modifying specific aspects of the model and evaluating the resulting impact on performance metrics. Table 10 summarizes the results of our ablation studies.\nTable 10: Ablation Study Results\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Table 10: Ablation Study Results\n</div>\nModel Configuration \nMAP \nNDCG@10 \nCTR \nFull Model \n0.457 \n0.521 \n3.9% \nw/o LLM Integration \n0.412 \n0.483 \n3.4% \nw/o Context Awareness \n0.398 \n0.465 \n3.2% \nw/o Query Expansion \n0.429 \n0.497 \n3.6% \nw/o Personalization \n0.435 \n0.502 \n3.7% \nThe ablation studies reveal the significant impact of the \nThe ablation studies reveal the significant impact of the\n\nLLM integration and context awareness components on the overall system performance.

Table 11 comprehensively compares vital performance metrics across all evaluated models.\nTable 11: Performance Comparison of Models\n\nModel \nMAP \nNDCG@10 \nCTR \nCR \nBM25 \n0.342 \n0.401 \n2.1% \n1.8% \nCollaborative \nFiltering \n0.375 \n0.438 \n2.5% \n2.2% \nMatrix \nFactorization \n0.389 \n0.456 \n2.8% \n2.4% \nBERT-based \nRanker \n0.415 \n0.483 \n3.2% \n2.7% \nWide & Deep \n0.431 \n0.502 \n3.5% \n3.0% \nDLCM \n0.443 \n0.513 \n3.7% \n3.2% \nProposed Method \n0.457 \n0.521 \n3.9% \n3.5% \nMatrix Factorization\n\nBERT-based Ranker\n\nDLCM\n\nOur proposed method consistently outperforms all baseline\nmodels across all evaluated metrics. The improvement is particularly notable compared to traditional information retrieval methods such as BM25, with a 33.6% increase in MAP and a 29.9% improvement in NDCG@10. Our system shows substantial gains compared to advanced deep learning models like BERT-based rankers and DLCM, with improvements of 10.1% and 3.2% in MAP, respectively [33].\nThe enhanced performance can be attributed to our system's\nsynergistic integration of large language models and contextaware techniques. The LLM component enables a deeper semantic understanding of user queries and product descriptions, while the context-aware framework allows for more nuanced and personalized product recommendations [34].\n\n# 5.2. Impact of Context-Awareness on Search\nQuality\n\nTo assess the impact of context-awareness on search quality,\nwe conducted a detailed analysis of system performance across various contextual dimensions [35]. Figure 7 illustrates the improvement in NDCG@10 for different user segments and contextual scenarios.\nFigure 7: Context-Aware Performance Improvement\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f46f/f46f818a-3f9a-4808-9c0d-754c441ec4f1.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nThe context-aware performance improvement visualization\npresents a multi-dimensional analysis of the system's effectiveness across various contextual factors. The figure features a radial plot with multiple axes, each representing a different contextual dimension (e.g., time of day, user demographics, device type) [36]. Concentric circles indicate the percentage improvement in NDCG@10 compared to the context-agnostic baseline. Colored regions represent different user segments, allowing for a comparative analysis of how context-awareness benefits various user groups. Annotations highlight particularly significant improvements or exciting patterns in the data [37].\nThe analysis reveals that context-awareness significantly\nenhances search quality across all examined dimensions. Temporal context, such as time of day and day of the week, consistently improves NDCG@10, ranging from 5% to 12%. User demographic contexts, including age and location, demonstrate even more substantial gains, with up to 18% improvements for specific segments.\nNotably, the impact of context-awareness is most pro\nnounced for users with limited interaction history, addressing the cold-start problem often encountered in recommendation systems [38]. For new users, the context-aware approach improves NDCG@10 by an average of 22.3% compared to context-agnostic methods.\n\n# 5.3. User Engagement and Conversion Rate\nAnalysis\n\nIntegrating context-aware product discovery has signifi\ncantly improved user engagement metrics and conversion rates. Table 12 presents a detailed breakdown of these metrics across different product categories.\nTable 12: User Engagement and Conversion Metrics by\nCategory\n\nCategory \nCTR \nImprovement \nCR \nImprovement \nAvg. \nSession \nDuration \nIncrease \nElectronics \n+18.2% \n+15.7% \n+24.3% \nFashion \n+22.5% \n+19.8% \n+31.2% \nHome & \nGarden \n+16.9% \n+14.2% \n+19.7% \nBooks \n+20.1% \n+17.5% \n+27.8% \nBeauty \n+24.7% \n+21.3% \n+33.5% \nThe data indicates substantial improvements across \n+33.5%\n\nThe data indicates substantial improvements across all\nproduct categories, with solid performance in categories such as Fashion and Beauty. These categories benefit from the system's ability to capture and utilize nuanced contextual information, such as seasonal trends and personal style preferences.\nThe average session duration increase suggests that users\nfind the search results more engaging and relevant to their needs. This enhanced engagement translates directly into higher conversion rates, with an overall improvement of 18.7% across all categories [39].\n\n# 5.4. Scalability and Efficiency Considerations\n\nWhile the proposed context-aware product discovery sys\ntem demonstrates superior performance, it is crucial to consider its scalability and efficiency for real-world e-commerce applications. We conducted experiments to evaluate the system's performance under varying loads and dataset sizes.\nFigure 8: Scalability Analysis\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/cdbf/cdbf8797-76f2-4a77-b0c6-f22fb55a418b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/7c14/7c14aa01-083c-48d1-8173-b3b0bf0b66ff.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nThe visualization of the scalability analysis presents a com\nprehensive view of the system's performance under varying conditions. The figure features multiple subplots: A line graph showing query response time vs. dataset size, with separate lines for different hardware configurations. A bar chart compares our system's throughput (queries per second) against baseline models at different scales. A heatmap illustrates the resource utilization (CPU, memory, GPU) for other system components under various load conditions. A scatter plot depicting the trade-off between model complexity (number of parameters) and prediction accuracy, with Pareto-optimal configurations highlighted. Annotations and color coding are used to emphasize critical findings and performance thresholds.\nThe analysis reveals that our system maintains sub-100ms\nresponse times for up to 10 million products, with linear\n\nscaling in computational requirements as the dataset size increases. Using efficient indexing techniques and model quantization allows the system to handle large-scale product catalogs without significant performance degradation [40].\nTo address the computational intensity of the LLM compo\nnent, we implemented a caching mechanism for common queries and product descriptions. This approach reduced the average query processing time by 37% while maintaining 98.5% of the original accuracy [39].\nThe system's modular architecture allows for horizontal\nscaling, with different components distributed across multiple servers. Load testing demonstrates that the system can handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with a 99th percentile latency of 250ms, meeting the requirements for high-traffic e-commerce platforms [40].\nThese results indicate that the proposed context-aware\nproduct discovery system offers superior search quality and meets the scalability and efficiency demands of modern ecommerce applications.\n\n# 6.
