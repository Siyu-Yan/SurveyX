## ⚠️ Note

- Our retrieval engine may not have access to many papers that require commercial licensing. If your research topic requires papers from sources other than arXiv, the quality and comprehensiveness of the generated papers may be affected due to limitations in our retrieval scope.
- We currently only support the generation of English academic survey generation. Support for other languages is not available.
- To ensure fair access for all users, each user is limited to one generation per day, prioritizing diverse user needs.

## ⚠️Disclaimer

SurveyX uses advanced language models to assist with the generation of academic papers. However, it is important to note that the generated content is a tool for research assistance. Users should verify the accuracy of the generated papers, as SurveyX cannot guarantee full compliance with academic standards.
