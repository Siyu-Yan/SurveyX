The goal of this research is to build algorithms that detect signals of such unusual moments so that doctors  can be proactive in approaching already diagnosed patients before they fall in depression. Each patient is equipped with a smartphone with the capability to track its sensors. We first find the home location of a patient, which is then augmented with other sensor data to identify sleep patterns and  select communication patterns. The algorithms require two to three weeks of training data to build standard patterns, which are considered normal behaviors; and then, the methods identify any anomalies in day-to-day data readings of sensors. Four smartphone sensors, including the accelerometer, the gyroscope, the location probe and the communication log probe are used for anomaly detection in sleeping and communication patterns. \n# I. Introduction\n# A. Motivation & Problem Statement \n Depression population, as of 2012, has exceeded 350  million worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (Marcus and Yasamy 2012). Depression is different  from simple mood fluctuations or temporary emotional responses because this disease can cause severe consequences to humans. Typical symptoms of depressions can range  widely from less severe ones such as difficulty concentrating and fatigue, to more serious indications such as persistent aches, feeling of anxiety and \u201cemptiness.\u201d In extreme  cases, depression can lead to suicidal attempts and in fact,  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports depression as one of the leading causes of suicides.   Even more critical issues are behind the fact that depression symptoms do not appear regularly. The patients function normally for the most of the time but become depressed at unexpected moments. Due to the inconsistent  nature of the disease, doctors may fail to preempt the  symptoms of a forthcoming depressive episode at the right \ntimes and struggle to take appropriate measures in a timely basis. For this reason, this research is to develop algorithms that automatically raise an alert to a doctor when his  or her patients are going through initial symptoms of a depressive episode.   Increasingly, smart phones are being used for behavioral  therapy, including in patients with depression.  While selfreported symptoms will continue to be a critical part of monitoring for these patients, self-reported data is always  subject to a certain level of bias.  Supplementing selfreported data with behavior data that tracks changes in activity will be an important component of comprehensive  monitoring programs.   We assume that the patient has already been diagnosed  with depression and equipped with a smart phone. The goal  is to predictively preempt episodes of depression attacks.  \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/6928/69288db0-9ba5-4fad-ac29-cf0226852ec1.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"> Figure 1. Flow diagram of how the abnormal behavior of patients is detected and reported to doctors. </div>\n# B. Proposed Approach\nTwo noticeable symptoms of depressive episodes are the changes in sleep patterns, either insomnia (if a person wakes up too early) or hypersomnia (if a person oversleeps), and the changes in daily activities, especially the loss of interest in social activities. In this research, we have exploited these two apparent changes in life patterns to determine a patient\u2019s state.  To do so, three algorithms have been developed. The location probe, also known as GPS, helps locating the patient\u2019s home location, which is essential to verifying the sleep patterns under the premise that people mostly sleep at home. The second algorithm utilizes the accelerometer and gyroscope to keep track of the motions of the smartphone. The home location and the device motion records return in-\nformation on sleep patterns. The third algorithm works  with the communication log probe and helps determine user\u2019s involvement in social activities. \n# C. Contributions and Prior Work\nAs the smartphones become more widespread, studies  using data sets from smartphone sensors are also emerging. Recently, Ginger.io Inc., has introduced a smartphone application that finds the times when a user is in depression.  However, there is a clear distinction in that this application  focuses only on communication patterns and travel distances; in contrast, our research largely concentrates on  finding the users\u2019 sleep patterns. No details are known to  the authors about the underlying methodologies of Ginger.io.  For the past decades, significant efforts have been invested to find algorithms that detect depression. For instance, there had been several studies on human actions to  identify depression symptoms. A research on facial actions  and vocal prosody has achieved accuracy of 88% in detecting the symptoms (Cohn et.al. 2009). Jarrold et.al. [2010]  conduct research on brain health by using data mining  tools to identify clinical depression and have also achieved  a high range of accuracy from 73% to 97%. However, the  outcomes of these studies are not able to detect the symptoms without interactions between the doctor and patient.  In essence, they are reactive in nature as opposed to our  study that focuses on being proactive and detection of depressive episodes. Smartphone based analysis can eliminate the needs for such interactions.  The two key patterns that our research focuses on are the sleep and communications patterns. There also have been  studies that monitor these patterns. A research on sleep  quality has utilized smartphones to detect sleep patterns using noise sensors (Hao et.al. 2013). However, their research mostly focused on sound aspects, such as snoring,  unlike sleep start hours and duration as is the case in our  research. Communication patterns had also been studied.  Similar to our research, Candia\u2019s et.al. [2008] research has  built an algorithm that detects anomalies in the communication patterns using phone records. Our research is clearly different from theirs in that we focus specifically on depressive episode symptoms and our algorithms are based  on the detection of both sleep and communication abnormal behaviors.  There has also been research that shares the exact same  purpose as ours (proactively detecting depressive episods)  but approaches the problem differently. Doryab\u2019s et.al.  [2014] study investigates social and sleep behaviors to detect any behavior changes using smartphones but their algorithm depends on correlation analysis whereas, our research uses clustering method and other different statistical tools. Another research done by Mok et.al. [2014] also \nbuilds a depressive episode detector. However, Mok\u2019s et.al. research examines the relationship between voice characteristics and depression instead of the relationship between  sleep, communication and depression as we do. \n# II. Sensors\n# A. Location Probe\nCommonly known as GPS, the location probe monitors  the smartphone user\u2019s location in latitude and longitude.  The rate at which the data is collected can differ depending on the settings of the device. \n# B. Accelerometer\nAccelerometer measures either the static or dynamic  forces the sensor is experiencing in x, y and z directions.  For instance, when a smartphone is laid down flat, the accelerometer returns a value close to (0,0,9.8), the z value  representing the gravity force. On the other hand, when the smartphone moves in the x direction with acceleration of  2 m s$, the sensor should show a value close to (2,0,9.8).  The actual measurements will never be exactly 2,0 or 9.8  in examples above due to noises. \n# C. Gyroscope\nGyroscope is a sensor that uses Earth\u2019s gravity to help  determine the orientation. Unlike accelerometer, gyroscope measures the rotations of a device in x, y and z directions.  For instance, when a smartphone is laid down flat, the gyroscope returns a value close to (0,0,0). When the  smartphone rotates in the x direction with 0.2'rad s, the  sensor should show (0.2,0,0). Similar to the accelerometer,  the actual measurements are approximates due to noises. \n# D. Communication Log Probe \nThe communication log probe in a smartphone mainly  monitors phone calls and SMS. Incoming, outgoing and  missed calls, and incoming and outgoing SMS are the five essential numbers collected from this log. \n# III. Model Training \nIn this section, we describe how normal behavior patterns can be built from two to three weeks of training data.  K-means clustering and confidence intervals are key methodologies in this portion of the research. We assume that  each patient is given a smartphone and that during the  training period the patient does not have depressive symptoms. This assumption is reasonable since for training a  few weeks of data are needed while periods between episodes are usually longer than a month.  \n# A. Home Location\nThe location probe typically records the latitude and  longitude as often as every second. Figure 2 shows locations of a test subject. High density of points suggests that  the smartphone user spent a long period of time at the same  location; hence, the location could represent places like  home, work or school. In contrast, locations with low density of points would be much less significant.  To take advantage of these density differences, the home  location algorithm uses the k-means clustering method.  Figure 3 shows a clustering while Figure 4 is the underlying scree plot justifying three clusters in this case because  there is a significant drop in the sum of square errors from  3 clusters to 4 clusters. Note that 4 clusters would create a  tighter clustering but at the expense of increased complexity. The scree plot shows that the trade-off is achieved for 3  clusters. We still need a method to distinguish the home  cluster among all other clusters. The home location algorithm only uses those data points that are recorded during  night hours, from midnight to 6am by default. Assuming  that the smartphone user lives with a typical life pattern  (work or school during the day and home during the night),  we can infer that the largest cluster of all will be the home  cluster. During the night hours, the home cluster should be  self-evident. In atypical cases such as night shift workers,  the algorithm is modified to select the data only from the  day time. In what follows for ease of exposition we assume  night time sleeping. Once the home cluster is chosen, the  algorithm simply assigns the center of cluster to be the  home latitude and longitude.  In clustering it is critical to choose an appropriate number of clusters to form. For this, we use the scree plot. The  detection of the number of clusters is automated by selecting a point on the curve where the slope decreases by a  substantial relative value.   The latitude and longitude of the largest cluster chosen  from the appropriate number of clusters during the night  hours then becomes the home location. \n# B. Sleep Pattern\nThe accelerometer and gyroscope provide very useful information that determines the sleep pattern. Due to the  challenges discussed later, the sleep pattern algorithm finds the longest interval during a day when the smartphone does not move and proclaims this as the sleep interval. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/161c/161c16a3-ab6b-45ec-923e-ff056dfea02a.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4e2e/4e2e6fd7-52ab-4a59-a716-77d4f3e8228a.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 3. The result of k-means clustering with appropriate number of clusters of three \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/9de2/9de29d30-ce2d-4991-89e1-da29ce467d29.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4. A sample scree plot that justifies three clusters.</div>\nHowever, because there could be multiple such long intervals, the longest interval we find may not necessarily  match with the sleep interval. For instance, a smartphone  user may not be an avid user and he/she may leave the device not moving for a long time throughout the day. In  such a case, the longest interval of a smartphone laying  down flat does not necessarily imply a sleep period.  Two assumptions allow us to find a more accurate sleep  interval. A person sleeps at home and at night (note that the latter assumption is already made by the home location detection algorithm). Given these two assumptions, the algorithm finds the longest interval of smartphone not moving  when the device is located at home during night hours. The algorithm is modified to accommodate atypical cases such  as night shift workers or people who spend extended periods of time away from home.  As previously mentioned, an accelerometer returns a  value close to (0,0,9.8) and a gyroscope returns a value \nclose to (0,0,0) when the smartphone lays flat. Therefore,  the longest interval that the data records do not deviate  from these values is the sleep interval. Sensors can never  be perfect because of the noise; hence, different error tolerances depending on the device must be taken into account.  Once the sleep intervals are determined throughout the  weeks of the training data, we perform another k-means  clustering to identify sleeping patterns (which for example  vary by the day of the week). The sleep interval consists of two components: sleep start hour on the x axis and sleep  duration on the y axis. Similar to the home location algorithm, the scree plot suggests the proper number of clusters. On the other hand, with the sleep intervals, we do not  find the largest cluster because the user may have several  different sleep patterns depending on the day of the week.   For instance, a person may sleep from midnight for six  hours from Sunday to Thursday and sleep from 10 pm for  eight hours on weekends. In this case, we do not want to  select the largest cluster but keep the two separate clusters  because they both represent normal behavior.   Events unrelated to depression may produces instances  of abnormal sleep during the two to three weeks of training data collection. Standard patterns built during those weeks  should only contain normal behaviors because these patterns are used for later inspection of anomalies. The algorithm therefore adapts an outlier detection algorithm to  avoid any abnormal behaviors in the standard pattern by  discarding sparse clusters far from dense clusters.  Figure 5 shows three distinctive clusters including a  small single data point cluster in the bottom right corner.  The two big clusters represent well behaved sleep patterns;  in contrast, the small cluster (bottom right corner) is a clear deviation from the two normal patterns. In such case, the  outlier algorithm will remove the small cluster and maintain only the two large clusters. \nclose to (0,0,0) when the smartphone lays flat.

A sample cluster plot with an outlier on the bottom right corner. \n# C. Communication Patterns \nOne symptom associated with depressive episodes is the loss of interest in social activities. The level of social activeness is well reflected in the use of smartphones for  communication. Hence, we can infer that the engagement \nwith the smartphone would decrease when the user is in an early stage of a depression.  The key components of the communication data are the  call and SMS logs. The depressive episode symptoms  should not be correlated with the incoming calls or the incoming SMS because a smartphone user does not have any control over them. Therefore, the communication algorithm utilizes numbers collected for outgoing and missed  calls and outgoing SMS only.  For this task, a confidence interval calculated from the  train data sets the regular pattern for later evaluations of  anomalies. The confidence interval assesses whether the  user\u2019s phone call and SMS usages are within a reasonable  range. The algorithm implements the 95% confidence level.  When calculating the confidence interval, the algorithm  first calculates the \u201cdelta\u201d values for all outgoing calls,  missed calls and outgoing SMS. The \u201cdelta\u201d values are the  daily changes in aggregate values. For instance, 10 outgoing SMS one day and 8 outgoing SMS the next day give  a delta of -2. Because we need to find times when social  activeness shows dramatic changes, the delta values are  more relevant than the raw values directly obtained from  the logs. Figure 6 shows a sample graph of the delta values and it demonstrates two dramatic drops in social activities  on the second and the third day.  The challenge in calculating the confidence interval is  that the delta values may be small and it could be hard to  obtain a good interval from small delta values. The phone  and SMS usage for most people do not fluctuate too much  from day to day and this may result in very small delta values. For this reason, the algorithm sums three consecutive  days worth of data and uses these values to build the confidence interval based on deltas. For example, if there have  been 5, 3, 4, 2 outgoing calls on a Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, we first sum values from Monday to Wednesday and also the values from  Tuesday to Thursday. These aggregated total values are  used to calculate the delta values and eventually the confidence interval.  \nwith the smartphone would decrease when the user is in an  early stage of a depression.  The key components of the communication data are the  call and SMS logs. The depressive episode symptoms  should not be correlated with the incoming calls or the incoming SMS because a smartphone user does not have any control over them. Therefore, the communication algorithm utilizes numbers collected for outgoing and missed  calls and outgoing SMS only.

An example of delta values of outgoing SMS</div>\nOne last factor that we have to consider is the change in  patterns on weekdays and weekends. For some people, social activities may increase over the weekends or for others, it could be the opposite. Therefore, the algorithm is  able to evaluate the weekday and weekend data separately. In such case, the three-day sum would only be applicable  to the weekdays but not weekends and there would be two  separate confidence intervals for weekdays and weekends.  Figure 7 is an example of the confidence interval obtained from the three-day sum values. The confidence interval obtained from the train data is later used to evaluate  the state of the smartphone user, i.e. patient. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/8afb/8afb1597-be76-46d3-88e9-c36fe2549153.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 7.

Anomaly Detection on Real Time\n In this section, we discuss how anomalies are detected in  real-time from model calibration based on the train data.  The home location will not be a subject of evaluation because it is only needed to help finding the sleep patterns.  Therefore, only the sleep and communication patterns are  used. \n# A. Sleep Pattern\nOnce calibrations are completed from the train data, it is  enough for the smartphones to collect the accelerometer  records and the gyroscope data in real time. Since, we obtained the exact home location from the train data, there is  no need for finding it again.  Analogous to calibration, the algorithm finds the longest  interval when the phone lays down flat while the device is  located at home at night, to figure out when and for how  long this patient has been sleeping on the day in question.  Since we formed clusters out of the sleep start hour and the  sleep duration, the algorithm determines whether the user\u2019s  sleep pattern on the day in question fits into any one of the  clusters from the calibration. If not, it indicates abnormal  behavior. \n# B. Communication Pattern \nJust as in training, we gather in real time the same three  items: outgoing calls, missed calls and outgoing SMS. Furthermore, because calibration is based on the delta concept  for three consecutive days, we do the same for real-time  data. In the case which the algorithm treats weekdays and  weekends differently as discussed previously, we would also make a distinction between them with test data as well.  With the calculated confidence interval, the algorithm  would treat different components of the data differently.  For outgoing calls and SMS, we disregard any value above  the upper limit because we are trying to find the times  when the patient is socially inactive. Therefore, on a dayto-day basis, the algorithm sums up the values of today and  the previous two days to see if the delta value drops below  the lower limit of the confidence interval. If so, it is likely  to indicate social inactiveness. On the other hand, we also  want to detect when the number of missed calls significantly rises. Hence, in this case, we can ignore too few missed  calls that are below the confidence interval, but an anomaly  occurs when the number of missed calls for the last three  days raises over the upper limit of the interval. As a result,  the times when the numbers of outgoing calls or SMS are  too small or the times when the number of missed calls  dramatically rises indicate abnormal behavior. In the case  of distinction between weekdays and weekends, the same  logic would apply to weekends, except everything will be  evaluated based on daily values instead of three day sums. \n# V. Study\n This section provides a sample study of the sleep and  communication pattern evaluations. The system consists of  the Android application PurpleRobot (Schueller et.al. 2014  and 1), which is installed on each smartphone provided to a  patient. The application streams the sensor data to a central  database in mongoDB. For training, the data over a period  of three weeks is downloaded to a relational database  (postgres) and the calibration is performed in R statistics.   This study represents data from normal volunteers in an  attempt to establish normal baselines to support future research. We discuss sample cases next. \n# A. Sleep Pattern\nFigure 8 shows a sample result of sleep pattern evaluations. In this specific example, we exhibit six days. The  \u201ccluster\u201d column shows the cluster that the new data belongs to. We notice that on the sixth day, the behavior of  the test user was clearly a deviation from the norm. The  user went to sleep at around 11:30am in the morning and \n1 CBITs TECH Website, PurpleRobot. URL:  http://tech.cbits.northwestern.edu/purple-robot/\nslept for about an hour and half. The cluster assigned to  this day was \u201cnone,\u201d which indicates that this day does not  belong to any of the clusters formed.  \n# B. Communication Pattern\nFigure 9 shows an evaluation result of weekday communication patterns. The \u201cP/F\u201d column gives information  about the state of the smartphone user. Value of 1 indicates  that the delta value is within the confidence interval. In  contrast, value of 0 suggests anomaly. Similarly, Figure 10  is a sample outcome for evaluations on weekend days, in  case the user decides to evaluate weekdays and weekends  separately. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/ba19/ba19ff68-bc2b-4df2-99a2-bb3030daa614.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 8.

Challenge and Improvements \n Although the sleep and communication pattern we find  with the algorithms can give us useful information about  the smartphone user\u2019s state, there exist limitations to this  research.   The biggest challenge is that the smartphone is an excellent source of data but not the perfect tool for finding a  sleep pattern. For instance, to find the sleep start hour, the  algorithm looks for an instance when the phone stopped \n \n ! weekday'1'\nweekday'2'\nweekday'3'\nOutgoing'Calls'\nDelta'Calls'\nCalls'P/F'\nOutgoing'SMS'\nDelta'SMS'\nSMS'P/F'\n1!\n112!\n113!\n114!\n1!\n0!\n1!\n3!\n0!\n1!\n2!\n113!\n114!\n115!\n2!\n1!\n1!\n5!\n2!\n1!\n3!\n114!\n115!\n118!\n4!\n2!\n1!\n6!\n1!\n1!\n4!\n115!\n118!\n119!\n3!\n+1!\n1!\n4!\n+2!\n0!\nFigure 9.

However, for some people, smartphones are not the very last thing that they interact with before going to sleep. Similarly, smartphone might not be the first thing people look for when they wake up. As a result, the biggest challenge is that we can never accurately figure out the exact sleep start hour and sleep duration from smartphones.  This is the reason why other similar studies try to deploy wearable devices rather than smartphones. These facts do not necessarily adverse our study, since instead of detecting sleep patterns, we can interpret our algorithms as detecting anomalies in phone use for extended periods of daily inactivity. This also serves the purpose for depression patients.   There are possible improvements to our methodology. Smartphones nowadays are equipped with more than twenty sensors. Possible options that could improve our methodology include the light sensor or proximity probe. The  light probe detects the brightness of the environment in Lux. However, this can also encounter challenges distinguishing between indoor and outdoor darkness. The proximity probe can play a pivotal role because it can directly tell whether the user is engaged with the phone or not. When the user is using the phone the proximity probe should record small distance values. \n# VII.

    "attri": {
        "background": "Depression affects over 350 million people worldwide and can lead to severe consequences, including suicidal attempts. Symptoms of depression are inconsistent, making it difficult for doctors to preemptively identify depressive episodes. This research aims to develop algorithms that alert doctors to early symptoms of depression using smartphone sensor data.",
        "problem": {
            "definition": "The problem is the inability to predict depressive episodes due to the unpredictable nature of symptoms, which can lead to delayed intervention by healthcare providers.",
            "key obstacle": "The main challenge is the sporadic appearance of depressive symptoms, which makes it difficult for existing methods to proactively identify and respond to patients in distress."
        },
        "idea": {
            "intuition": "The idea is inspired by the observation that changes in sleep patterns and social interactions can indicate early signs of depression.",
            "opinion": "The proposed idea involves using smartphone sensors to monitor sleep and communication patterns to detect anomalies that may signal the onset of depressive episodes.",
            "innovation": "The innovation lies in the integration of multiple smartphone sensors to provide a comprehensive analysis of both sleep and communication behaviors, contrasting with existing methods that focus on single aspects."
        },
        "method": {
            "method name": "Predictive Analytics Using Smartphone Sensors",
            "method abbreviation": "PASS",
            "method definition": "PASS utilizes data from smartphone sensors to identify behavioral anomalies indicative of depressive episodes by analyzing sleep and communication patterns.",
            "method description": "The method incorporates algorithms that analyze sensor data to detect deviations from established normal behavior patterns associated with depression.",
            "method steps": [
                "Collect training data from smartphone sensors over two to three weeks.",
                "Identify home location using GPS data.",
                "Analyze accelerometer and gyroscope data to determine sleep patterns.",
                "Evaluate communication logs to assess social activity levels.",
                "Apply clustering and outlier detection algorithms to identify anomalies."
            ],
            "principle": "The effectiveness of this method is based on the premise that significant deviations in established behavioral patterns can serve as early indicators of depressive episodes."
        },
        "experiments": {
            "evaluation setting": "The experiments utilize data collected from normal volunteers using the PurpleRobot application, which streams sensor data to a central database for analysis.",
            "evaluation method": "The evaluation involves comparing real-time sensor data against established normal patterns using statistical methods, including k-means clustering and confidence intervals."
        },
        "conclusion": "The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively identifies anomalies in sleep and communication patterns, providing a proactive approach to monitoring and potentially preventing depressive episodes.",
        "discussion": {
            "advantage": "The key advantage of this approach is its ability to provide continuous monitoring of patients without requiring direct interaction, allowing for timely interventions.",
            "limitation": "Limitations include the reliance on smartphones for sleep detection, which may not accurately capture sleep patterns as users may not interact with their phones right before sleeping.",
            "future work": "Future research could explore the integration of additional sensors, such as light and proximity sensors, to enhance the accuracy of sleep detection and overall behavioral analysis."
