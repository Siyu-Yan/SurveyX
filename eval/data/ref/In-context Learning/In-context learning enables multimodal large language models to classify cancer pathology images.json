However, this process is computationally and technically demanding. In language processing, in-context learning provides an alternative, where models learn from within prompts, bypassing the need for parameter updates. Yet, incontext learning remains underexplored in medical image analysis. Here, we systematically evaluate the model Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 with Vision capabilities (GPT-4V) on cancer image processing with in-context learning on three cancer histopathology tasks of high importance: Classification of tissue subtypes in colorectal cancer, colon polyp subtyping and breast tumor detection in lymph node sections. Our results show that in-context learning is sufficient to match or even outperform specialized neural networks trained for particular tasks, while only requiring a minimal number of samples. In summary, this study demonstrates that large vision language models trained on non-domain specific data can be applied out-of-the box to solve medical image-processing tasks in histopathology. This democratizes access of generalist AI models to medical experts without technical background especially for areas where annotated data is scarce.\n# Introduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is about to transform healthcare. While its potential is immense, it also presents unique challenges in medicine, arising from the field\u2019s inherent complexity and the critical need for accuracy and reliability1. Over the last years, applications of AI have been developed that focus on specific areas, especially computer vision models in radiology2 and pathology3, or skin cancer detection4 for oncology.\nHistopathology plays a central role in diagnosing diseases, notably cancer, and has consistently been at the forefront of computational advancements in medicine5. Recent developments have enabled the detection of cancer subtypes6 and biomarkers like genetic alterations7 which can potentially stratify and improve patient care directly from routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained microscopic images7. The current gold standard for computational pathology is training vision foundation models8 based on a vast and diverse dataset of images and that can easily be customized for clinically relevant applications9-10. However, these foundation models need a substantial volume of domain-specific images during training, and are restricted to vision applications only. Moreover, before being applied to a medical task, these models require an additional re-training stage (fine-tuning) that is in itself computationally demanding11 and requires additional annotated training data. This last step needs to be repeated for every potential application, which limits researchers to develop these models at scale. In-context learning - a concept borrowed from the field of natural language\nprocessing (NLP) - could provide a possible solution to this problem. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to learn from a few handcrafted examples that are provided to the LLM alongside the prompt, holds great potential and has been shown to improve model performance12. A practical implementation in a medical setting might involve presenting the LLM with a detailed clinical scenario, such as a complex oncology case, accompanied by several comparable instances with different strategies on how to solve a certain challenge. This approach is called few-shot prompting. Numerous methodologies have been developed utilizing in-context learning. Their foundational principles are explained in detail in the \u2018Supplementary Methods: In-Context Learning\u2019 section. In the medical field, one model has recently been built upon the aforementioned paradigms: MedPrompt13, which is based on the GPT-4 architecture. Central to this method is the application of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) search, which herein helps identifying the most relevant few-shot examples for a specific clinical input. This process involves comparing text embeddings, which are numeric representations of words with the input in question and then selects samples with the closest alignment. We highlight further implementation details of this approach, as it has partial overlap with the methods developed in our study, in the \u2018Supplementary Methods: Related Work - Enhancing LLM strategies\u2019 section. However, a major shortcoming is the restriction to text-based tasks. Medicine is a highly multimodal discipline, where a comprehensive understanding of a patient\u2019s symptoms or diagnoses requires information from diverse data sources such as radiographic and microscopic imaging, clinical reports, laboratory values and electronic health records14. Only recently, the AI community has entered into the field of vision language models, exemplified by the release of GPT-4V15, the announcement of Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini16 family or open-source variants like LLaVA17, BakLLaVa18 or Fuyu-8B19. Building on the trend of large vision language foundation models, we hypothesize that the principles applied for in-context learning of text-based models can be equally effective when extended to multimodal scenarios, such as medical imaging. In the non-medical setting, robust evidence for in-context learning with images has already been established20. Especially, in the medical field, where generating annotated ground truth data presents a critical challenge, the potential for performance improvements through this approach could be immensely beneficial. This issue is also of relevance for underrepresented medical cases, such as rare tumor types, which receive insufficient representation in traditional deep learning training pipelines. Moreover, the concurrent integration of textual, theoretical knowledge and visual information could pave the way towards a more holistic understanding of multidimensional medical data. In this study, we present results of benchmarking the efficacy of in-context learning with GPT-4V against dedicated image classifiers across three histopathology benchmarking datasets. Notably, we demonstrate that the performance of GPT4V in tissue classification can be improved through in-context learning and is on\npar with specialist computer vision models. This advancement casts doubt on the necessity of developing task-specific deep learning models in the future and democratizes access to generalist AI models to accelerate medical research.\n# Methods\nEthics statement\nThis study does not include confidential information. All research procedures were conducted exclusively on publicly accessible, anonymized patient data and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, maintaining all relevant ethical standards. The overall analysis was approved by the Ethics commission of the Medical Faculty of the Technical University Dresden (BO-EK-444102022).\n# Datasets\nOur benchmarking experiments are conducted on the following, open-source histopathology image datasets:\n\u2022 CRC-VAL-HE-7K21 is the evaluation set associated with the NCTCRC-HE-100K dataset, consisting of 7,180 image patches extracted from hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections from 50 individuals with colorectal cancer. Samples were collected at the NCT Biobank (National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg, Germany) and the UMM pathology archive (University Medical Center Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) and digitized at 224x224 pixels (px) at a resolution of 0.5 microns per pixel (MPP). Throughout this manuscript we will refer to this dataset as CRC100K. Following previous studies9,32, the background (BACK) class was excluded from our analysis. \u2022 PatchCamelyon (PCam)23 contains 327,680 H&E stained histologic image patches at 96x96px (0.243 MPP) from human sentinel lymph node sections obtained from the Camelyon16 Challenge, originally split into a training and validation set. Samples are annotated with a binary label to denote the presence or absence of metastatic breast cancer tissue at a balance close to 50/50. \u2022 MHIST22 is a dataset of 3,152 H&E-stained FFPE-sections from colorectal polyps, collected at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) and addresses the challenging problem of discriminating sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) from hyperplastic polyps (HP)33. Images are scanned at 224x224 px and labeled as either HP or SSA by the majority vote of seven pathologists, resulting in a 3:7 split.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/2bbc/2bbc9bd6-7239-40ee-a299-f92131ff8011.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nDataset\nCRC100K\nPatchCamelyon\nMHIST\nDescription\nH&E patches from 86 WSIs of\nhuman colorectal cancer\nHistologic images of lymph\nnode sections with or without\nmetastatic breast cancer\nMicroscopic images of\ncolorectal polyps\n# samples\n7180\n32768\n3152\nclasses\nADI, BACK*, DEB, LYM,\nMUC, MUS, NORM, STR,\nTUM\nTumor, No Tumor\nSSA, HP\n# eval\nbinary\n60\n60\n60\ncomplete\n120\n-\n-\nFigure 1: Comprehensive schematic.

A selection of random test images was drawn from each of these datasets for evaluation using three distinct methodologies: Zero-Shot Classification (Method 1), random fewshot sampling (Method 2) and kNN based selection (Method 3). For the latter, feature extraction was performed using the Phikon ViT-B 40M Pancancer model (*). Cosine similarity was used as the comparison metric between the target image and its closest k neighbors in embedding space. As a benchmark against GPT-4 ICL, we trained four image classifiers (indicated by +, namely ResNet-18, ResNet15, Tiny-Vit and Small-Vit) via transfer learning from ImageNet for each target image (Panel B). For an in-depth understanding of these methods, please refer to Algorithm 1 and the Experimental Design section. * The BACK (background) label was excluded from analysis.\nFor GPT-4V inference testing, we generated randomly chosen test datasets containing 60 samples for MHIST and PatchCamelyon and 120 samples for CRC100K at a balanced 1:1 split for each of the available labels. For simplicity, we restricted the test images from the MHIST dataset to those achieving unanimous expert consensus for the presence of SSA or HP, respectively.\n# GPT-4V Model Specifications\nAll experiments in this study were performed using the GPT-4V model in the chat completions endpoint of the official OpenAI Python API between November 15 and December 03 2023. The official model name in the OpenAI API is gpt-4-vision-preview. For simplicity, we will use the term GPT-4V in all subsequent references to this model throughout our manuscript. Temperature was set to 0.1 based on initial experiments and no other modifications to model hyperparameters were made. For further implementation details, we refer to our official github repository.\n# Prompting and random few-shot image in-context learning\nIn the following we present a brief overview of the implementation of the final prompts used in GPT-4V. For an in-depth explanation of both the system prompt (instructions dictating the expected model behavior) and user prompt (input commands or queries to the model), please refer to Appendix B. There is currently no standardized blueprint for the development of effective model prompts; rather this is an iterative, dynamic process driven by trial and error34. Our prompting strategies were developed on a selection of ten random image tiles per label from each dataset. Following current best practices, we utilized the system prompt to establish the setting (context) to the model and to guide\nits expected behavior. In our initial trials with GPT-4V, we encountered several limitations due to the model\u2019s intensive policy alignment regarding its refusal of handling medical data. To address these issues, we modified our approach by presenting test cases as hypothetical scenarios (\u2018None of your answers are applied in a real world scenario or have influences on real patients.\u2019) and additionally included a selection of desired and undesired response pairs into the system prompt, which are included in Appendix B. For simplifying analysis of the results, we also configured GPT-4V to generate answers in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. This included a structured template containing a field for providing logical reasoning (\u2018thoughts\u2019), the final \u2018answer\u2019 as well as a certainty \u2018score\u2019. Regarding the user prompt, we differentiate between the zero- and few-shot settings. In the zero-shot scenario, we started with enumerating all possible label options, followed by guiding the model to adopt a step-wise reasoning akin to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting35. This was followed by a compilation of dataset-specific considerations: For instance, in the CRC100K dataset, we observed that the model would almost always choose to classify an image tile as tumor whenever detecting malignant cells, despite simultaneously recognizing the major cell fraction being lymphocytes. To counteract these dataset- specific pitfalls, we included concise guidelines at this step (Appendix B). Finally, GPT4V was asked to thoroughly examine the appended patient image and provide its answer as described above. In the few-shot sampling prompts, we presented a sequence of k example images (where k equals 1, 3, 5 or 10), each followed by its corresponding label, in a repeated pattern: Specifically, we presented a single image corresponding to each label, cycling through the entire set of labels k times as further highlighted in Appendix A. Each image was prefaced with the phrase \u2018The following image contains\u2019. Then GPT-4 was instructed to closely compare and extract meaningful knowledge from the images for a subsequent comparison with the target image. Beyond this, the structure of the prompt remained consistent to the zero-shot template. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, we followed all known best practices and prompting tricks (i.e. \u2018Take a deep breath\u2019)36. To mitigate the risk of overfitting on the samples used during the refinements of the system and user prompts, we ensured that they were not included in the generation of inference test data. More specifically, we performed an initial investigation of zero-shot and random few-shot performance using an initial dataset comprising 30 random samples, collected exclusively from the CRC100K dataset; each containing either tumor or normal colon epithelium. This initial dataset served a dual purpose: developing effective prompts and providing an early insight into model responses. For the following evaluation phase, we collected a new subset of 30 samples. This way, we prevented sample leakage from our prompt creation dataset into our final evaluation testset. This was critical to prevent overfitting that could arise from sample-specific biases we might have included into the prompt. However, these samples were allowed to be part of either random or (as described in the next section) kNN-based sample selections. This process was repeated for every dataset.\n# kNN-based few-shot image sampling\nThe entire workflow is summarized in detail in Algorithm 1 (Appendix A). Image feature vectors were created for each of the above described datasets using the teacher backbone of the \u2018Phikon\u2019 Vision Transformer (ViT-B 40M Pancancer)9 leading to a one- dimensional vector of length 768 for each image tile. During GPT-4V inference, for each test image x, the k closest images of each possible target label y were sampled for kNN-based in-context learning by measuring the cosine similarity in feature space. To prevent the model from learning patient-intrinsic morphologic tissue features as confounder to the desired label, we removed tile embeddings from the same patient if this information was available. Nevertheless, the main goal of our study is the comparison between GPT-4V in-context learning and training of specialized image classifiers. As outlined later, the comparisons are still valid in cases where overlap between test image and related patient tiles might occur, due to exactly matching in-context learning and training samples. The example images were included in the prompt in a way that the most similar images for each label were shown to the model first.\n# Tile-Level Classification Benchmarks\nIn this study, we compared few-shot image in-context learning of GPT-4V with linear probing on specialized computer vision models by training a classification layer atop four distinct models: ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ViT-Tiny, and ViTSmall. Each model was initialized with ImageNet pretrained weights as a standard procedure7,37. Considering the relatively small test sample sizes in the experiments involving GPT-4V, we ensured a balanced comparison by training a newly initialized model on the identical set of random- or kNN-sampled and normalized images for each test image across all datasets, leading to a total of 3,600 trained models (Number of models \u00d7 Total number of datasets \u00d7 (Number of shots - zero shot) \u00d7 Number of samples per dataset). Every training run was performed for ten epochs, employing the Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, and utilized cross-entropy as the loss function. Due to the balanced target label distribution, unweighted accuracy scores are reported for each of the models. All experiments were performed on an Apple MacBook Pro M2 Max 96GB.\n# Data availability\nAll datasets used in this study are publically available and can be downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/DykeF/NCTCRCHE100K (CRC100K), https://github.com-/basveeling/pcam (PatchCamelyon) and https://bmirds.github.io/MHIST/ (MHIST).\nCode availability We will provide all materials and code to reproduce and extend the analyse that were performed in this study upon publication.\n# Results\nIn-context learning with medical images improves classification accuracy for histopathology\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0695/0695e932-a8cb-4f02-80a3-5d99f42de21e.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n1 Figure 2: In-context learning for vision-language models. Panel A shows that classification accuracy of tumor (TUM) versus non-tumor (NORM) tiles from the CRC100K dataset can drastically be improved by leveraging ICL through few-shot image samples.

In this study we hypothesize that few-shot prompting can improve performance of foundation vision models. This hypothesis has been shown with text-only tasks, but remains unclear for its application to biomedical images. We first evaluate this hypothesis on a binary classification task between tumor (TUM) and non-tumorous normal mucosa (NORM) tissue tiles from the CRC100K dataset21. As shown in Figure 2A, GPT-4V only marginally surpasses the expectation of random guessing when used in a zero-shot setting, attaining an accuracy of 61.7% (CI: 0.5 to 0.733). In-context learning changes this situation: We see a\nFigure 2: In-context learning for vision-language models.

In our subsequent ablation study (Fig. 2B), we compare random versus kNN sampling across the MHIST22 and PatchCamelyon23 (PCAM) datasets. From a zero-shot baseline that again barely achieves a better classification than random guessing (MHIST accuracy 56,7%, CI: 0.433 to 0.683; PCAM accuracy 60%, CI: 0.467 to 0.717), we see that in both datasets, random image sampling can improve classification accuracy. These results can further be improved by selecting the sampled images based on their similarity to the target image (kNN sampling), which results in the best achieved accuracy of 83.4% and 88.3% for detecting sessile-serrated adenoma over hyperplastic polyps (MHIST, CI: 0.733 to 0.917) and lymph-node metastases from breast cancer versus tumor-free lymphatic tissue (PCAM, CI: 0.8 to 0.95) in a ten-shot setting. In summary, these results demonstrate that in-context learning can improve the performance of foundation vision models in classifying histopathology images. Moreover, we show that kNN sampling can further enhance accuracy over random sampling, especially when increasing the number of images that are shown to the model.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/812c/812cd99e-1726-4493-af6a-90d88b3ebfb0.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 3: Performance Analysis on PatchCamelyon and MHIST datasets.

Zero, One, Three, Five and Ten denote the number of in-context learning versus training samples respectively.\n# Vision-Language Models can achieve performance on par with retrained vision classifiers\nNext, we compare few-shot sampling with the current status-quo7 in image classification, which involves retraining models from ImageNet weights. To ensure a fair comparison, we train one distinct model for each target image shown to GPT-4V, with the identical images used for in-context learning as the training set. This approach reveals that in-context learning is sufficiently robust to achieve results that are on par with, or even surpass, specialized narrow image classifiers under the same conditions. Specifically, the ten-shot in-context learning GPT-4V approach not only matches, but exceeds the performance of all other models (Fig. 3A), leading to a classification accuracy of 83.3% for MHIST (CI: 0.733 to 0.917) and 88.3% for PatchCamelyon (CI: 0.8 to 0.95), outperforming the second-best model, Tiny-ViT, by 3.3% and 6.6% respectively. Notably, in the case of PatchCamelyon, even the three- and five-shot prompting\nwere sufficient to outperform all other models in this setting.\nWe also discover that GPT-4V demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities for some of the targets: For PatchCamelyon, it correctly identified all tumor tiles, albeit with a high false positive rate of 80%. In the MHIST dataset it correctly recognized 83% of Sessile Serrated Adenomas, but only 30% of Hyperplastic Polyps (Figure 3B). Considerable improvements could be observed with fewshot prompting. In the case of PatchCamelyon, the model\u2019s ability to identify normal lymph node tissue progressively increased with the number of example images, ranging from an accuracy of 67% for three-shot, 77% for five-shot to 80% for ten-shot image prompting. Similarly, for MHIST, the correct identification of hyperplastic polyps could be increased from 30% (zero-shot) to close to 90% (ten-shot). Notably, these enhancements did not compromise the model\u2019s performance in detecting tumors in the PatchCamelyon dataset or SSAs in the MHIST dataset (Figure 3C). These findings show that in-context learning with microscopic images can achieve an accuracy on par with fine-tuning specialized image classification models.\n# Vision-Language Models can classify images in a multilabe setting\n# Vision-Language Models can classify images in a multilabel setting\nIn a subsequent task, we evaluated GPT-4V on the CRC100K dataset, which is more challenging as it consists of a more diverse set of labels. Herein, GPT-4V displayed notable improvements as we raised the number of few-shot image samples, although it did not reach the performance levels of specialist models as seen before with PatchCamelyon or MHIST (Fig. 4A). The model natively excelled in identifying tumor and muscle tissue, achieving a recall score of 80% and 100%, respectively. However, it failed completely in recognizing debris (DEB), adipose tissue (ADI), lymphocytes (LYM), mucus (MUC) and tumor-associated stroma (STR). Herein, three instances are particularly noteworthy: lymphocytes were consistently misclassified as tumor tissue, debris was incorrectly categorized as tumor in 93% of cases, and stroma was misclassified as muscle tissue in 87% of instances. The addition of few-shot examples led to a substantial improvement. The best results are achieved with five-shot kNN-sampling, where the model receives a total of 40 sample images. This leads to an enhanced accuracy across all labels (Fig. 4B). A clear trend of continuous performance gains is evident as the number of few-shot samples are increased, demonstrating consistent improvements at each stage of the process (from zero- to one-, one- to three-, and three- to five-shot prompting) for almost all labels (LYM, MUC, NORM, STR), with the exception of debris(Fig. 4C). Details to confidence intervals are summarized in Table 1. In summary, our findings underline the potential of few-shot image learning in GPT-4V, even in a multilabel classification setting.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/e361/e361b9da-0f5e-4e69-80fb-3a4082090ed5.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\nFigure 4: Performance analysis on the CRC100K dataset. The line graphs (Panel A) show the comparative average performance of GPT-4V against the four image classification models.

Detailed average accuracy values, including confidence intervals are summarized in Table 1. # Samples refers to the count of few-shot ICL samples for GPT-4V and training samples for the other models. Panel B features confusion matrices for GPT-4V in both zero-, and five-shot kNN-based sampling scenarios (n=120 samples). The spiderplot showcases the average classification accuracy per label per number of kNN-sampled shots, revealing a general trend towards increased classification accuracy across most labels with scaling of the number of few-shot image samples (Panel C).\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n\n# Image in-context learning improves text-based reasoning\nVision-Language Models enable multimodal understanding. To more accurately evaluate the impact of few-shot image sampling on textual reasoning within VLMs, we further investigated the output of GPT-4V and created text embeddings using Ada-002. Analyzing these embeddings with t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), we saw the formation of distinct text-embedding clusters, which highlight the existence of an inherent correlation between the textual and image level. However, in a zero-shot scenario, this was not reflected when comparing text embeddings to the ground truth labels. This indicates that the model\u2019s knowledge and reasoning about a given image is not sufficient to consistently guide it towards the correct label. The implementation of few-shot sampling, however, contributes to a more pronounced separation of different labels within the embedding space (Fig. 5A), both compared to the provided model answer and the underlying ground truth. These data show that few-shot sampling assists the model to generate a consistent text-level reasoning trajectory to distinguish different targets. To showcase the benefits multimodality might have in histopathology, we present two illustrative cases from our study. Figure 5B (left) depicts a scenario where GPT-4V falsely classifies an image as tumor, while the underlying ground truth was considered to be stroma.\nHowever, GPT-4Vs detailed reasoning, identifying morphological signs indicative of cancer, reveals the presence of tumor cells, characterized by irregularly shaped nuclei. Analyzing the 500 closest image embeddings in feature space shows a similar trend, with two-thirds of image embeddings being categorized as tumors. Another case, shown in Figure 5B (right), demonstrates GPT-4V\u2019s proficiency in transferring knowledge from different domains to draw the right conclusions. Overall, these data show that vision language models hold great learning potential for medical image classification through only a handful of sample images given into the prompt and might inherently have advantages over classical image classifiers due to their multimodal architecture.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/95c1/95c17f6f-71d1-44fd-8c6e-cc078083715f.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 5: Few-shot sampling improves text-based reasoning. Panel A depicts the workflow, starting from GPT-4V\u2019s initial prediction and its reasoning process (\u2018thoughts\u2019), to the generation of text feature embeddings with Ada 002. The panel of t-SNEs demonstrates the evolution from a zero-shot framework on the far left, advancing through one-, three-, and five-shot kNN sampling to the right on n=120 samples from the CRC100K dataset. All data is obtained from the CRC100K dataset. In the t-SNE plots, color coding distinguishes between the model\u2019s final classifications (\u2018Answers\u2019, top) and the ground truth (\u2019Labels\u2019, bottom). The introduction of few-shot image sampling noticeably refines the model\u2019s textual reasoning, as evidenced by the formation of more distinct clusters in alignment with the model\u2019s own responses (top) and the underlying ground\ntruth (bottom). In Panel B, we present two exemplary scenarios to demonstrate the potential superiority of integrated vision-language models over stand-alone image classification models. On the left, an image is displayed where the original annotation identified the sample as stroma (STR), yet GPT-4V categorizes it as tumor (TUM). The rationale provided by the model appears plausible, notably pointing out several abnormally shaped nuclei, visible for instance in the lower right corner. This sample indeed appears to represent a borderline case. When comparing the top 500 closest patch embeddings to the reference image, a dominant fraction is classified as tumor (67%), with a lesser proportion being labeled as stroma (32%) and a negligible percentage (<1%) as lymphocytes or regular colon epithelium. The exploration of GPT-4V\u2019s interpretive process unlocks novel avenues for identifying and understanding such complex edge cases that go beyond what is possible with conventional image classifiers alone. Right: Chicken-wire patterns are described in the histology of liposarcoma, which arises from adipocyte precursor cells. This description stems from its resemblance to chicken wire fences (shown to the right). GPT-4V effectively leverages this knowledge from another context to describe the morphology of the adipocytes shown in this image. This way of performing \u2019transfer learning\u2019 could have strong implications in teaching. * The image name in the CRC100K cohort is STR-TCGA-VEMARASN. + The image name in the CRC100K cohort is ADI-TCGA-QFVSMHDD.\n# Discussion\nFoundation models have demonstrated substantial promise in medical image processing. Zhou et al. trained such a system using 1.6 million retinal images and illustrated that they can then fine-tune it with fewer annotated images to assist clinicians in identifying a range of ocular diseases24. Yet, the vast amount of data that is required and the necessity to develop one specific fine-tuned version for each clinical task, currently constrain training these models at scale, limiting their utility to researchers with extensive knowledge in computer sciences and access to the required hardware. Furthermore, the applicability of these models has been confined to the visual field only. Nonetheless, learning is a multimodal process. For example, in pathology, practitioners and students assimilate their knowledge by extracting visual patterns from images and synthesizing them with corresponding textual annotations. In summation, the ideal scenario would envision AI systems that seamlessly combine multimodal information in a data efficient manner while having the flexibility to adapt their behavior to any given task on demand without the need for traditional retraining. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept illustrating that achieving these properties is possible with in-context learning on vision language models, exemplified on GPT-4V: We show that this method not only is effective when classifying medical microscopy images but also that it can achieve performance comparable to conventional image classification models trained on the same\namount of data. These results are encouraging, especially considering that current state-of-the-art pathology foundation models like Paige\u2019s Virchow25 yield performance metrics that marginally surpass our method, with reported accuracy scores of 82.7% compared to 83.3% for GPT-4V on the MHIST dataset and 92.7% versus 88.3% for GPT-4V on PatchCamelyon. For MHIST, we must note here, that we excluded images without a full inter-rater agreement, which makes our use case most likely easier than the one used by Vorontsov et al25. We acknowledge the lack of public access to the training corpus of GPT-4V, which raises the possibility that the model may have been trained on our test sets. Nevertheless, the performance observed in a zero-shot scenario marginally surpasses random guessing, making it less likely that the data had been used for training. We use this zero-shot baseline as a comparison to investigate the benefit of in-context-learning. With our approach, we lay the foundation for a general purpose framework that advances state-of-the-art prompting techniques to images. Additionally, our findings reveal that carefully selecting high-quality, few-shot examples can significantly enhance model performance. A notable aspect is the integration of text with vision, which fosters a new dimension of explainability in understanding a model\u2019s reasoning processes. This addresses a critical limitation of conventional image classifiers, as textual feedback provides a more comprehensible way of understanding and interpretability for humans compared to visual tools such as Grad-CAM26. This aspect is crucial for reliable AI systems in medical applications 27. Some limitations of our work are that experiments were restricted to a yet small sample size due to the preview status of the GPT-4V API, which currently only permits a limited number of requests. To ensure equitable comparisons despite these limitations, every experiment was conducted using the same set of sample images across both GPT-4V and all image classifiers developed in this study. Another limitation in this regard is that we did not include ensembling methods, which would require multiple model iterations over the same task as performed by MedPrompt or Med-PaLM 2, which has a total of 44 model calls for a single task only28. Moreover, it is worth noting that the performance of in-context learning with images sometimes yields suboptimal results, particularly in classes like debris, mucus and stroma within the CRC100K dataset. This observation is in line with findings by Huang et al.29. While these outcomes have been acknowledged, we leave an in-depth investigation into the underlying reasons and the development of potential solutions as subjects for future research. Finally, the current reliance of our approach on generating and retrieving image embeddings through a specialized vision model (i.e. Phikon) is a drawback to the philosophy of an all-encompassing foundation VLM, which ideally would not require a specialized vision encoder to generate features. Although we have not tested this at scale due to the rate limits of the API, we speculate that the next generation of foundation models will be able to autonomously manage, embed and retrieve sample data on demand for few-shot learning. Following the current paradigm of AI scaling laws30,31, it can be estimated that we have not yet reached a plateau in the performance benefits from even more powerful foundation models\nin the future. Furthermore, our experiments have not indicated any saturation point in model efficacy when increasing the number of k-shot examples. Again this suggests the potential for continued enhancements when further scaling our approach and raises the question about the necessity and efficacy of researchers to develop their own specialized deep learning models for each task, particularly when a singular model may suffice in the foreseeable future. In summary, we further aim to scale our work to overcome these limitations and extend it to other domains like radiology imaging. Nevertheless, we believe that in context-learning with images holds great potential for improving performance of vision language models on biomedical image classification tasks and beyond.\n# References\n1.

Emerging as a novel core capability of large foundation language models1, it temporarily enhances a model\u2019s inherent knowledge and proficiency in solving a certain task, by learning from a small set of similar question-answer pairs that are provided in the prompt. The art of selecting the most effective combination of prompts and example solutions for similar tasks is known as prompt engineering2.\nThe most prominent technique, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (\u2018Let\u2019s think step by step.\u2019), helps the model provide more accurate answers3 by disassembling complex problems into smaller components and manually guiding the model\nto sequentially build a solution strategy. Several advancements have been developed on top of CoT prompting, notably the introduction of self consistency CoT4 (which involves selecting the majority vote after aggregating multiple responses) and Tree-of-Thoughts prompting5 (which allows the model to travel along different lines of reasoning). These methodologies, while presenting a favorable trade-off between minimal effort and significant improvements in model responses, still face shortcomings: They typically require expert level knowledge and labor-intensive manual crafting that leads to highly specialized prompts and limits their generalizability across various domains. As a potential resolution to this challenge, a recent study has investigated leveraging LLMs themselves to autonomously generate their own prompts6, thereby mitigating the need for expert surveillance. Nevertheless, although the need for specialized prompts has traditionally been viewed as a limitation due to its impact on generalizability, this characteristic can be advantageous in scenarios where generalizability is not required anyways, for instance when tailoring prompts to individual patient cases.\n# Related Work - Enhancing LLM strategies\nMed-PaLM 27 set state-of-the-art results in May 2023 on multiple medical benchmarking datasets through a combination of instruction finetuning (re-training of the LLM PaLM 2 on high quality medical training datasets) and self consistency CoT together with a new technique, called ensemble refinement. In the latter, the LLM is iteratively conditioned on multiple different reasoning paths (arising from prompting the model with the same task multiple times while introducing randomness into the token sampling procedure generating the answer) before providing a final answer to a question. More recently, GPT-4 has also been augmented through an ensemble of prompt engineering techniques, summarized by the authors as MedPrompt8. Without domain specific finetuning, MedPrompt recycles the concepts of ensembling and self-generated CoT reasoning, but additionally introduces the idea of kNN few-shot sampling. The core principle is to provide the LLM with the most appropriate combination of k few-shot pairs that exist between a dataset D and a target image t by measuring the similarity (i.e., cosine distance) between their embeddings in feature space. This approach equips the LLM with context that closely aligns with the target case. Text embedding models like OpenAI\u2019s Ada 002 can be utilized to generate comprehensive text embeddings (\u2018feature vectors\u2019)9 for large text datasets. Employing this methodology, MedPrompt was able to further improve on the results achieved by Med-PaLM 2 on the MultiMedQA benchmark.\n# Related Work - Computational Pathology\nTraditionally, computational pathology has relied on image classification models derived from outside the medical domain via transfer learning from ImageNet. These models, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet10 or\nInception11 have served as robust feature extractors for downstream applications. While having learned generic visual representations from natural images, significant challenges arise from the unique and intricate properties of histological images. Among various factors, these images display complex patterns at cellular, subcellular and tissue levels, a unique color distribution and naturally possess rotational invariance, distinguishing them markedly from standard imagery12. Yet, the primary limitation lies in the dependency on extensively annotated datasets, a challenge that becomes particularly critical in the medical field where annotated data is notably scarce13. Recent advancements have therefore turned to self-supervised learning as a strategy to derive meaningful representations from large volumes of unlabeled data14\u201318. The primary goal is to create potent feature extractors that catch general morphologic features inside the images and can further be trained for downstream applications, like for instance image classification or genetic modeling. Models like CTransPath19, Phikon20, Virchow21 and others22 are currently emerging as the most potent (foundation) models to date.\nAlgorithm 1: Pseudocode for kNN based In-Context Learning.\n.
