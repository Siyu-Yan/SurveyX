Auditors collect, weigh, and combine information in formulating their judgment about the truth/fairness of their clients\u2019 financial statements. A financial audit is broken up into components, corresponding to e.g. legal entities, branches, departments, as well as separate business cycles (e.g. order-to-cash, procure-to-pay,), their related balance sheet and income statement accounts, and the company\u2019s assertions about these accounts (e.g. their completeness, existence, accuracy, valuation). To collect evidence pertaining to each assertion, auditors choose a mixture of procedures, e.g. risk assessment, the testing of effectiveness of internal controls, statistical and non-statistical sampling. Procedures may be geared to all aggregation levels, ranging from the entity as a whole to a specific assertion of a specific part of a financial statement account. The objective of the auditor then is to aggregate all evidence obtained to issue an opinion as to whether the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the company. As precise guidelines for information collection, and evaluation in auditing do not exist, individual and collective professional judgment plays a key and pervasive role in auditing [27].\n*Krishna Manoorkar is supported by the NWO grant KIVI.2019.001 awarded to Alessandra Palmigiano\nData analytic techniques in auditing Text-analysis techniques, AI and data-analytic methods have already been very useful to speed up the controlling function of auditors by flagging low-level, individual anomalies [29, 44, 38, 58, 57]. However, even in the absence of low-level anomalies, it is an auditor\u2019s task to detect higher-level anomalies concerning the coherence of all information at different aggregation levels: indeed, one and the same event or action in the life of a company is witnessed as evidence at multiple levels (e.g. at the overall financial statement level, at the account level, at the transactions stream level, and at the individual assertion level of accounts). Also, certain items of evidence pertain to multiple assertions of an account. For example, confirmation of accounts receivables pertains to the \u201cExistence\u201d and \u201cValuation\u201d assertions of the account receivable balance. Challenges The extant research on the formal foundations of the reasoning at the core of auditing [48, 54, 52, 53, 35] has highlighted several inadequacies of probability theory for representing uncertainty in audit judgments, the most prominent of which are the logical implications stemming from the complementarity of probabilities, and the ensuing difficulty in drawing the key distinction between the absence of evidence in support of a statement and the presence of evidence to its contrary. This literature has advocated the use of Dempster-Shafer theory [14, 47] to overcome this problem. However, the extant literature has not yet developed specific formal models for audit on which machine learning algorithms can be designed and tested. This paper tries to provide a Dempster-Shafer based formal framework which can be used by machine learning algorithms to detect both low-level and high-level anomalies.\nData analytic techniques in auditing Text-analysis techniques, AI and data-analytic methods have already been very useful to speed up the controlling function of auditors by flagging low-level, individual anomalies [29, 44, 38, 58, 57].

Specifically, we posit that the experienced auditors\u2019 evaluation of evidence is rooted in a process of category-formation, by which pieces of evidence are clustered together in categories which are possibly very different from the \u201cofficial\u201d categories with which the evidence is presented in the self-reported financial statement of the given firm. These categories provide the context of evaluation in which different and possibly very heterogeneous pieces of evidence are compared with/against each other, and their overall coherence is evaluated. Here we use tools from Formal Concept Analysis, modal logic, and Dempster-Shafer theory to create a framework for creating and analyzing such categorizations and then show how the framework can be used to obtain interpretable machine learning algorithms for outlier detection and classification allowing for easier interaction of algorithms with human experts. Background theory The formal framework presented in this paper is set within many-valued Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) [59, 3], in which (vague) categories are represented as the formal concepts associated with bipartite weighted graphs seen as fuzzy formal contexts [59, 3], each consisting of domains A (of objects) and X (of features), and a weighted relation I between them. One particularly relevant example for the present paper concerns clustering of nodes of a bipartite graph which represents the network of financial transactions (i.e. a financial statements network) [7]. Mathematically, bipartite graphs and formal contexts are isomorphic structures; moreover, both types of structures are used to represent data [59, 50, 30, 39, 23, 45, 62, 9]. Regarding bipartite graphs as formal contexts allows for access to the well-known representation of the hierarchy of formal concepts associated with each formal context [4], and hence provides a formally explicit categorization process. FCA provides: 1. a hierarchical, rather than flat, categorization of objects. 2. categories that have a double (i.e. both extensional and intensional) representation, which allows to make them explainable, in the sense that each category can be effectively reconstructed in terms of its features. 3. a more structured control of categorization based on the generation of categories from arbitrary subsets of objects or of features. That is, we can add or remove objects or features from the categorization in a standard manner. 4. the basis for a formal framework for addressing and supporting vagueness, epistemic uncertainty, evidential reasoning, and incomplete information [60, 11, 10, 18].\nAims and contributions The present paper develops formal models specifically designed to analyse and represent the higher-level processing of information of experienced auditors, and at using this formal understanding to develop machine learning tools to flag higher-level anomalies.

Mathematically, bipartite graphs and formal contexts are isomorphic structures; moreover, both types of structures are used to represent data [59, 50, 30, 39, 23, 45, 62, 9]. Regarding bipartite graphs as formal contexts allows for access to the well-known representation of the hierarchy of formal concepts associated with each formal context [4], and hence provides a formally explicit categorization process. FCA provides:\nFinancial statements networks [7] are bipartite graphs G = (A, X, I), where A is the set of business processes, X is the set of financial accounts (e.g. tax, revenue, trade receivables), and I : A\u00d7 X \u2192[\u22121, 1] is such that, for any business process a and any financial account x, the value of I(a, x) is the share of a into x, where the (positive or negative) sign of I(a, x) represents whether money is credited into or debited from x in a, respectively. A business process is the set of credit and debit activities meant to produce a specific output [7], e.g. all the transactions relating to a sale of an object. A collection of records in any journal entry data can be mapped to a particular business process. Any business process a can then be described in terms of the values of I(a, x) for any x \u2208X. This description yields a categorization of business processes which can be of interest in auditing [7, 5]. To make processing and interpreting contexts easier, many-valued formal contexts G = (A, X, I) as above may be converted into two-valued formal contexts using conceptual scaling [20]. Interrogative agendas As mentioned above, the final outcome of the auditing process is the formation of a qualitative opinion, by expert auditors, on the fairness and completeness of a given firm\u2019s financial accounts. Towards the formation of their opinion, not all features have the same weight in the eyes of the auditors: indeed, different auditors may have different views about which parts of the financial accounts they consider more relevant to the formation of their opinion. If a certain set of features has significantly more relevance to an agent (auditor), we can model this situation by letting this set of features to be the agenda of that agent. In many cases, the agenda of an agent may not be realistically approximated in such a simple way, but might consist of different relevance or importance values assigned to the different set of features. We will use Dempster-Shafer mass functions to represent such agendas. Another reason why features do not have the same weight or importance to an auditor is because different departments or groups of transactions may have different perceived degree of risk leading an auditor to assign different importance to different financial accounts involved. Similarly to the different epistemic attitudes entertained by experts auditors, also different procedures used in auditing may focus unequally on different features (financial accounts). Categorizations of business processes based on different features may be useful in analyzing effectiveness of different methods for different business processes. This may also be helpful in categorization of errors obtained from such methods, a topic of significant interest in auditing [22, 49]. In the proposed framework, the different epistemic attitudes of expert auditors are formalized by the notion of interrogative agenda [17]. This framework can also be used to provide a better understanding of source and extent of concerns, and in making decision about which additional data may be needed in decision-making.\nA formal framework We introduce a formal framework specifically designed to systematically represent and reason about the different ways business processes can be categorized on the basis of different agendas of the different agents (expert auditors), as well as the possible aggregations of these categorizations, by means of a deliberation process. This logical framework is crucial for developing machine learning algorithms which are explainable and support working in presence of uncertain or incomplete data in a formal way.\nPreference-aggregation via generalized Dempster-Shafer theory We extend the logical framework described above to the cases where the different interrogative agendas of the agents might induce different priorities over the set of features used for categorization. Such priorities can be represented as Dempster-Shafer mass functions on the set of features. These mass functions also induce mass functions on different categorical hierarchies, and represent priorities for each categorization based on these agendas. Dempster-Shafer theory has been applied to model reasoning under uncertainty about categorization of objects and features, or for describing preferences for certain categories in a given categorization [18]. In the same work, a Dempster-Shafer mass function is defined over a given concept lattice representing evidence for a set of objects or features belonging to a category or preference in that category. Here, we take a different approach, and use Dempster-Shafer theory to describe the priority or importance of different set of features in categorization using Dempster-Shafer mass functions. That is, mass functions are used to choose which categorization is most suitable for a given task. We then try to formalize deliberation between the agents with different agendas represented by mass functions using aggregation rules in Dempster-Shafer theory.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/9865/9865230c-07b7-4949-9c78-78a330cc7d69.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Left: categorization from the agenda of j1, Right: categorization from the agenda of j3.</div>\nStructure of the paper In Section 2, we describe a small financial statements network and show how different sets of features give different categorizations of business process in this small network. In Section 3, we give required preliminaries. In Section 4, we describe our logical framework for reasoning with categorizations obtained from different interrogative agendas. In Section 5, we use this framework to model some deliberation scenarios. In Section 6, we describe non-crisp interrogative agendas given by Dempster-Shafer mass functions and categorizations obtained from these. In Section 7, we try to formalize possible deliberation scenarios among agents having agendas represented by Dempster-Shafer mass functions. In Section 8, we present our meta-learning algorithm for outlier detection and classification, and demonstrate it through an outlier detection algorithm obtained by this methodology. Finally in Section 9, we give our conclusions and mention several directions for future research.\n# 2 Example\nIn this section, we informally illustrate the ideas discussed in the introduction by way of an example. Conside the financial statements network represented in the Appendix, with business processes {a1, a2, . . . , a12} an financial accounts {x1, x2, . . . , x6} specified as follows:\nx1\ntax\nx2\nrevenue\nx3\ncost of sales\nx4\npersonnel expenses\nx5\ninventory\nx6\nother expenses\nAs discussed above, each cell of the Table in the Appendix reports the value of the (many-valued) relation I : {a1, . . . , a12} \u00d7 {x1, . . . , x6} \u2192[\u22121, 1], which, for any business process a and account x, represents the share of a in x. Let j1, j2, and j3 be agents with different agendas. Specifically, agent j1 is interested in the financial accounts x1, x2, and x5 (inventory), agent j2 in x1, x2, and x3, while agent j3 is interested in x1, and x3. The various ways of categorizing {a1, a2, . . . , a6} (i.e. forming concept lattices) under these different agendas by using interval scaling 1 with 5 intervals of equal length between [\u22121, 1] are shown in Figure 1. It is clear that the categorizations obtained differ from each other depending on criterion used. For example, business processes a1, a3, a5 are indistinguishable under the agenda of j2, while a2 forms a singleton category under the agenda of j3, and hence is distinguishable from all other business processes. The business process forming smaller categories may be considered uncommon and may be of further interest in auditing tasks. However, as shown by the above example, this is influenced by the set of features or agenda used for categorization.\n1Interval scaling is one of the methods used commonly for conceptual scaling.

Formal contexts can be thought of as abstract representations of databases, where elements of A and X represent objects and features, respectively, and the relation I records whether a given object has a given feature. Every formal context as above induces maps I(1) : P(A) \u2192P(X) and I(0) : P(X) \u2192P(A), respectively defined by the assignments I(1)[B] \ufffd{x \u2208X | \u2200a(a \u2208B \u21d2aIx)} and I(0)[Y] \ufffd{a \u2208A | \u2200x(x \u2208Y \u21d2aIx)}. A formal concept of P is a pair c = ([[c]], ([c])) such that [[c]] \u2286A, ([c]) \u2286X, and I(1)[[[c]]] = ([c]) and I(0)([c]) = [[c]]. A subset B \u2286A (resp. Y \u2286X) is said to be closed, or Galois-stable, if Cl1(B) = I(0)[I(1)[B]] = B (resp. Cl2(Y) = I(1)[I(0)[Y]] = Y). The set of objects [[c]] is the extension of the concept c, while the set of features ([c]) is its intension2. The set L(P) of the formal concepts of P can be partially ordered as follows: for any c, d \u2208L(P), c \u2264d iff [[c]] \u2286[[d]] iff ([d]) \u2286([c]). (3.1) With this order, L(P) is a complete lattice, the concept lattice P+ of P. As is well known, any complete lattice L is isomorphic to the concept lattice P+ of some formal context P [4].\nFormal contexts and their concept lattices A formal context [21] is a structure P = (A, X, I) such that A and X are sets, and I \u2286A \u00d7 X is a binary relation.

A formal concept of P is a pair c = ([[c]], ([c])) such that [[c]] \u2286A, ([c]) \u2286X, and I(1)[[[c]]] = ([c]) and I(0)([c]) = [[c]]. A subset B \u2286A (resp. Y \u2286X) is said to be closed, or Galois-stable, if Cl1(B) = I(0)[I(1)[B]] = B (resp. Cl2(Y) = I(1)[I(0)[Y]] = Y). The set of objects [[c]] is the extension of the concept c, while the set of features ([c]) is its intension2. The set L(P) of the formal concepts of P can be partially ordered as follows: for any c, d \u2208L(P), c \u2264d iff [[c]] \u2286[[d]] iff ([d]) \u2286([c]). (3.1) With this order, L(P) is a complete lattice, the concept lattice P+ of P. As is well known, any complete lattice L is isomorphic to the concept lattice P+ of some formal context P [4]. Dempster-Shafer theory Belief and plausibility functions are one proposal among others to generalise probabilities to situations in which some predicates cannot be assigned subjective probabilities. In this section, we collect preliminaries on belief and plausibility functions on sets. Belief, plausibility and mass functions A belief function (cf. [47, Chapter 1]) on a set S is a map bel : P(S ) \u2192[0, 1] such that bel(S ) = 1, and for every n \u2208N, bel(A1\u222a, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u222aAn) \u2265 \ufffd \u2205\ufffdI\u2286{1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n} (\u22121)|I|+1bel \uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed \ufffd i\u2208I Ai \uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8.\nFormal contexts and their concept lattices A formal context [21] is a structure P = (A, X, I) such that A and X are sets, and I \u2286A \u00d7 X is a binary relation.

On finite sets, belief (resp. plausibility) functions and mass functions are interchangeable notions: any mass function m as above induces the belief function belm : P(S ) \u2192[0, 1] defined as belm(X) := \ufffd m(Y) for every X \u2286S, (3.2)\n\ufffd \u2286 and conversely, any belief function bel as above induces the mass function mbel : P(S ) \u2192[0, 1] defined as We use standard notation and terms from Dempster-Shafer theory which can be found in any common reference fo it, for example, see [46, 61]. \ufffd\n\ufffd \u2286 and conversely, any belief function bel as above induces the mass function mbel : P(S ) \u2192[0, 1] defined as We use standard notation and terms from Dempster-Shafer theory which can be found in any common reference for\nDefinition 1.

In epistemology and formal philosophy, an epistemic agent\u2019s (or a group of epistemic agents\u2019, e.g. users\u2019) interrogative agenda (or research agenda [17]) indicates the set of questions they are interested in, or what they want to know relative to a certain circumstance. Interrogative agendas might differ for the same agent in different moments or in different contexts; for instance, my interrogative agenda when I have to decide which car to buy will be different from my interrogative agenda when I listen to a politician\u2019s speech. In each context, interrogative agendas act as cognitive filters that block content which is considered irrelevant by the agent. Only the information the agent considers relevant is actually absorbed (or acted upon) by the agent and used e.g. in their decision-making, in the formation of their beliefs, etc. Interrogative agendas can be organized in hierarchies, and this hierarchical structure serves to establish whether a given interrogative agenda subsumes another, and define different notions of \u201ccommon ground\u201d among agendas. Deliberation and negotiation processes can be understood in terms of whether and how decision-makers/negotiators succeed in modifying their own interrogative agendas or those of their counterparts, and the outcomes of these processes can be described in terms of the \u201ccommon ground\u201d agenda thus reached. Also, phenomena such as polarization [37], echo chambers [56] and self-fulfilling prophecies [34] can be understood in terms of the formation and dynamics of interrogative agendas among networks of agents. Financial statements networks. A financial statements network is constructed from journal entry data, which describe the change in financial position and that is readily available in all companies. The journal entry records show how much money flows from one set of financial accounts to another set. These entries are generated by their underlying business process, for example, the Sales process. A financial statements network is a bipartite digraph G = (A \u222aX, E) with X as the set of financial account nodes and A as the set of business process nodes and E \u2286X \u00d7 A as the set of directed edges. Clearly, each bipartite digraph G = (A \u222aX, E) as above can be equivalently represented as a formal context P = (A, X, E). The set of financial accounts and business processes are can be obtained from the journal entry data. The structure represents the relative amounts debited and credited for each financial account. Although amounts can be different, all journal entries with the same structure are considered equal. A formal definition of a business process can be written as [7] \ufffd \ufffd\n\ufffd \u2264\u2264 \ufffd \u2264\u2264 where m is the number of credited financial accounts, n is the number of debited financial accounts and \u03b1i is the relative amount with respect to the total credited and \u03b2j the relative amount with respect to the total debited. The arrow here represents the flow of money between the accounts. The (weighted) edges between nodes xi or y j and B are the coefficients \u03b1i and \u03b2j in the Equation (3.4).\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n# 4 Interrogative agendas, coalitions, and categorization\nIn this section, we introduce the logical framework we use to formalize different agents, their agendas or features of interest, and the categorizations obtained from such agendas. As discussed in Preliminaries, interrogative agendas are in essence research agendas or sets of features of interest to agents. Here we model interrogative agendas as (crisp or non-crisp) subsets of the set of features under consideration. This basic framework naturally lends itself to be enriched with various kinds of logical operators, such as epistemic operators, which represent the way in which the interrogative agenda of an agent (or a group of agents) is perceived or known by another agent (or group), and dynamic operators, which encode the changes in agents\u2019 interrogative agendas.\nTypes. Let P = (A, X, I) be a (finite) formal context obtained from a bipartite graph. Let C be a (finite) set of agents. Let C = (P(C), \u222a, \u2229, (\u00b7)c, \u22a5, \u22a4) and D = (P(X), \u2294, \u2293, (\u00b7)c, \u03f5, \u03c4) be the Boolean algebras join-generated and meet-generated by elements of C and X, respectively. Any agent j and issue m can be identified with an atom (join-generator) of C and a co-atom (meet-generator) of D, respectively. That is, agents and issues in our formal model are defined as elements of the sets C and D respectively. We interpret any c \u2208C as a coalition of agents j \u2208C, and we read j \u2264c as agent j being a member of coalition c. Similarly, we interpret any d \u2208D as the interrogative agenda supporting all the issues m \u2208X such that m \u2265d. That is, in this formal model coalitions and interrogative agendas are defined to be arbitrary subsets of C and D respectively. From here on, we use d \u2208D, and the set Y = {m \u2208X | m \u2265d} interchangeably to denote an interrogative agenda consisting of all issues in the set Y.\n# Unary heterogeneous connectives. Consider the following relation:\n# Unary heterogeneous connectives. Consider the following relation: R \u2286X \u00d7 C mRj iff issue m is relevant \n \u2286 \u00d7 The relation R induces the operations \ufffd, \u25b7: C \u2192D defined as follows: for every agent j, let \ufffdj = \u25b7j := \ufffdR\u22121[ j], where R\u22121[ j] := {m | mRj}. Then, for every c \u2208C, \ufffd \ufffd\n\ufffd { | \u2264} \ufffd { | \u2264} Under the intended interpretation of R, for every coalition c, the interrogative agenda \u25b7c denotes the distributed agenda of c (i.e. \u25b7c is the interrogative agenda supporting exactly those issues supported by at least one member of c), while \ufffdc is the common agenda of c (i.e. \ufffdc is the interrogative agenda supporting exactly those issues supported by all members of c). Algebraically: \u25b7c \u2264m iff \u25b7j \u2264m for some j \u2264c and \ufffdc \u2270m iff \ufffdj \u2270m for some j \u2264c. For an example illustrating common and distributed agendas see the Appendix.\nProposition 2. For all c1, c2 \u2208C, 1.\ufffd(c1 \u222ac2) = \ufffdc1 \u2294\ufffdc2 and \ufffd\u22a5= \u03f5 2. \u25b7\u22a5= \u03c4 and \u25b7is antitone 3.\u25b7(c1 \u222ac2) = \u25b7c1 \u2293\u25b7c2, where \u03f5, and \u03c4 denote the bottom and top of the Boolean algebra D respectively.\n \u2208 1.\ufffd(c1 \u222ac2) = \ufffdc1 \u2294\ufffdc2 and \ufffd\u22a5= \u03f5 2. \u25b7\u22a5= \u03c4 and \u25b7is antitone 3.\u25b7(c1 \u222ac2) = \u25b7c1 \u2293\u25b7c2, where \u03f5, and \u03c4 denote the bottom and top of the Boolean algebra D respectively.\nLet X1 \u2286X be an interrogative agenda. This agenda induces a context P1 = (A, X1, I1), where I1 = I \u2229A\u00d7X1 on P. Formal context P1 denotes the context of interest for an agent with agenda X1. Let R denote the set of all formal contexts induced from P. We define an information ordering on all such induced contexts as follows: For any P1 = (A, X1, I \u2229A \u00d7 X1), and P2 = (A, X2, I \u2229A \u00d7 X2)) in R,\n \u2264  \u2286 The order \u2264I defines a lattice on the set of induced formal contexts from P, R = (R, \u2228I, \u2227I) as follows. For any P1 = (A, X1, I \u2229A \u00d7 X1), and P2 = (A, X2, I \u2229A \u00d7 X2)), P1 \u2227I P2 = (A, X1 \u2229X2, I1 \u2229I2) and P1 \u2228I P2 = (A, X1 \u222aX2, I \u2229A \u00d7 (X1 \u222aX2)). The following proposition follows from the definitions in a straight-forward manner.\n \u2264  \u2286 The order \u2264I defines a lattice on the set of induced formal contexts from P, R = (R, \u2228I, \u2227I) as follows. For any P1 = (A, X1, I \u2229A \u00d7 X1), and P2 = (A, X2, I \u2229A \u00d7 X2)),\nProposition 3. Let P1, P2 be the formal contexts induced from P such that P1 \u2264I P2. Then for any B \u2286A if B is Galois-stable in set in P1, then it is Galois-stable in P2 as well.\n\u25a1\nThus, a larger agenda corresponds to a larger formal context in information ordering, and in turn to a finer categorization. This is consistent with the intuition that the larger agenda means larger information considered for differentiating objects leading to finer categorization. The following corollary is immediate from the Proposition 3.\nFor any c, f1(c) and f2(c) are interpreted as the \"categorization according to features of interest to the all members of c\" and \"categorization according to features of interest to at least one member of c\" respectively. The following proposition defines order theoretic properties of operations f1, f2 in terms of information ordering \u2264I on induced formal contexts.\n1.f1(c1) \u2264I f2(c1) 2.If c1 \u2264c2, then f1(c2) \u2264I f1(c1), f2(c1) \u2264I f2(c2) 3.f1(c1 \u2228c2) = f1(c1) \u2227I f1(c2) 4.f2(c1 \u2228c2) = f1(c1) \u2228I f1(c2).\n1.f1(c1) \u2264I f2(c1) 2. 3.f1(c1 \u2228c2) = f1(c1) \u2227I f1(c2) 4.\nProof. Follows immediately from the definitions and Proposition 2.\n# 4.1 Substitution of issues in agendas\nConsider the following relation: S \u2286X \u00d7 C \u00d7 X such that S (n, j, m) iff agent j would substitute issue m with issue n in an agenda. The relation S induces the operation > : C \u00d7 D \u2192D defined as follows: for every agent j and issue m, let j > m := \ufffdS (1)[ j, m], where S (1)[ j, m] := {n | S (n, j, m)}. Intuitively, j > m is the interrogative agenda supporting exactly the issues that agent j prefers to issue m. Deliberation often involves agents substituting issues from other agents\u2019 agenda in attempt to reach a common agreement. The substitution relation allows us to model deliberation scenarios which can lead us to a new compromised agenda containing issues which may not be present in the initial agenda of any of the agents. (See example in the Appendix). Then, for every c \u2208C and e \u2208D, \ufffd\n\ufffd {  | \u2264 \u2264} Intuitively, c > e is the agenda representing the shared view among the members of c of how the issues in e should be modified.\nProposition 7. For every e \u2208D and all c1, c2 \u2208C, 1.\u22a5 > e = \u03f5 and c > \u03c4 = \u03f5 2. (c1 \u222ac2) > e = c1 > e \u2294c2 > e 3. > is antitone in its second coordinate 4.c > (e1 \u2293e2) = c > e1 \u2294c > e2, where \u03f5, and \u03c4 denote the bottom and top of the Boolean algebra D respectively. Proof. See Appendix. \u25a1 The basic requirement for S of a rational agent is the following condition of coherence with R. Definition 8. We say that the relation S is coherent with R if \u2200j\u2200m[mRj =\u21d2S (m, j, m)]. The coherence condition can be interpreted as if agent j considers m to be relevant issue then she will be okay with replacing it with itself.\nProposition 7. For every e \u2208D and all c1, c2 \u2208C, 1.\u22a5 > e = \u03f5 and c > \u03c4 = \u03f5 2. (c1 \u222ac2) > e = c1 > e \u2294c2 > e 3. > is antitone in its second coordinate 4.c > (e1 \u2293e2) = c > e1 \u2294c > e2, where \u03f5, and \u03c4 denote the bottom and top of the Boolean algebra D respectively.\n\u25a1\n# 5 Deliberation and categorization\nLet j1 and j2 be two agents with agendas X1 = R\u22121( j1) and X2 = R\u22121( j2) respectively. Let e1 = \u2293x\u2208X1x and e2 = \u2293x\u2208X2x. Let S be any coherent substitution relation. We consider some possible outcomes of deliberation between these agents. 1. f1(c) = X1 \u2229X2 = {m \u2208X | m \u2265\ufffdc}. This corresponds to situation when agents decide to choose issues which are interest to both of them as common agenda. 2. f2(c) = X1 \u222aX2 = {m \u2208X | m \u2265\ufffdc}. This corresponds to situation when agents decide to choose issues which are interest to either of them as common agenda. 3. e = j1 > e2 \u2293j2 > e1. This can be interpreted as agents making changes to agenda of other agent based on their preferences (substitution relation) and then taking union of substituted agendas. 4. e\u2032 = j1 > e2 \u2294j2 > e1. This can be interpreted as agents making changes to agenda of other agent based on their preferences (substitution relation) and then taking intersection of substituted agendas. Several other possible deliberation scenarios can be modeled in a similar manner. In the Appendix we describe some deliberation examples using these rules. Proposition 9. For any substitution relation S , let Y1 = {m \u2208M | m \u2265e}, and Y2 = {m \u2208M | m \u2265e\u2032}. Let P and P\u2032 be the contexts P = (A, Y1, I \u2229A \u00d7 Y1), and P\u2032 = (A, Y2, I \u2229A \u00d7 Y2). 1. P\u2032 \u2264I P 2. If S is coherent, then f1( j1 \u2228j2) \u2264I P\u2032 1. Proof. 1. As e \u2264e\u2032, we have Y\u2032 \u2286Y. Therefore, by definition of \u2264I, we have P\u2032 \u2264I P. 2. As S is coherent, we have Y1 \u2229Y2 \u2286{y \u2208X | y \u2265j1 > e} and Y1 \u2229Y2 \u2286{y \u2208X | y \u2265j2 > e2}. Thus, Y1 \u2229Y2 \u2286Y\u2032. Therefore, f1( j1 \u2228j2) \u2264I P\u2032 1. \u25a1 Thus, if S is coherent the issues of interest to both agents are also part of their aggregated agenda. This also provides justification for coherence being a rationality condition. Indeed if a feature is considered relevant by both agents in deliberation, it is natural that it should be considered relevant by them after deliberation.\n# 6 Non-crisp interrogative agendas\nIn this section, we extend ideas developed so far to the non-crisp3 case. Suppose different agents have mass functions describing their interest or preference in different set of issues i.e. for agent j we have a mass function mj : P(X) \u2192[0, 1] where for any Y \u2286X, mj(Y) denotes preference of agent to use set of features (agenda) Y as a criterion for categorization. This mass function can be seen as a Dempster-Shafer mass function on the set P(X). A particular cases of interest from a practical point of view are when mj is simple mass function. Definition 10. For any Dempster-Shafer mass function m : P(S ) \u2192[0, 1] a set Y \u2286S is said to be focal set of m if m(Y) > 0. A Dempster-Shafer mass function m : P(S ) \u2192[0, 1] is said to be simple iff it has at most one focal set X \u2282S . Suppose that an agent j mentions that she considers a set of features Y \u2286X to be of high importance (given by \u03b1 \u2208[0, 1]) for categorization. In this case, the agenda of agent j may be represented by a simple mass function m j(Y) = \u03b1 and mj(X) = 1 \u2212\u03b1. Here, we do not have any information about how j intends to distribute importance (or preference) 1 \u2212\u03b1 between different features for categorization. Thus, we assign this mass to the set X to denote non-availability of information regarding its distribution. Example 11. Suppose an agent j assigns different importance to each feature individually. In this case the mass function representing agenda of j is given by a simple mass function mj : P(X) \u2192[0, 1], for any Y \u2286X, m(Y) \ufffd v(x)\nSuppose that an agent j mentions that she considers a set of features Y \u2286X to be of high importance (given by \u03b1 \u2208[0, 1]) for categorization.

The term crisp signifies the fact that model has a fixed set of agendas and thus leads to a single categorizati While, the term non-crisp highlights that the Dempster-Shafer mass functions give different priority or preference values to different sets features (agendas) and leads us to a mass function on different possible categorizations.\n3We use the terms crisp and non-crisp in this paper to talk about agendas given by a set of features, and a Dempster-Shafer mass function on the of features respectively. The term crisp signifies the fact that model has a fixed set of agendas and thus leads to a single categorization. While, the term non-crisp highlights that the Dempster-Shafer mass functions give different priority or preference values to different sets of features (agendas) and leads us to a mass function on different possible categorizations.\nAny Dempster-Shafer mass function m : P(X) \u2192[0, 1], induces a probability mass function m\u2032 : R \u2192[0, 1] given by m\u2032((A, Y, I\u2229A\u00d7Y)) = m(Y). For any P \u2208R, m\u2032(P) gives extent to which categorization P is preferred by agent with agenda given by m. Thus, given a non-crisp agenda represented by a Dempster-Shafer mass function on P(X), we obtain a preference function (which can also be seen as a probability function) on the contexts (or categorizations) induced from P. For any non-crisp agenda m, induced probability mass function m\u2032 on R defines a probability function pm\u2032 given by pm\u2032(V) = \ufffd P\u2208V m\u2032(P) for any V \u2286R.\n#  \ufffd 6.1 Non-crisp agendas in decision-making\nNon-crisp interrogative or the probability function on categorization induced by them may possibly be used directly in some categorization applications. However, in many applications it may be desirable to obtain a crisp categorization approximating this non-crisp categorization. The most natural way to obtain such a categorization is to choose the categorization with the highest preference or probability value attached to it. However, this choice ignores a large amount of information of interest in other alternative categorizations. Another possible solution is to estimate importance of each feature from the mass function using plausibility transform [8], pignistic transformation [28, 51], or decision probability transformation based on belief intervals [15]. The importance values of features thus obtained can then be used as weights in computing proximity or dissimilarity between different objects based on features shared and not shared between them. The dissimilarity or proximity data obtained in such a way can be used to cluster objects based on any of the several clustering techniques [25, 24, 33]. However, this method can only be used to obtain a clustering (that is a flat categorization) and not a concept lattice (a hierarchical categorization). Here, we propose a novel stability-based method to form a crisp formal context from given probability function on the set of induced contexts (categorizations) which produces a hierarchical categorization of objects.\n# 6.1.1 Stability-based method\nDefinition 12. Let P = (A, X, I) be the formal context under consideration and let R be the set of induced formal contexts. Let m\u2032 : R \u2192[0, 1] be the induced probability mass function on categorization induced by an agenda given by mass function m : P(X) \u2192[0, 1]. Then for any G \u2286A, the stability index of G is given by \u03c1m(G) = \ufffd {m\u2032(P1) | G is Galois-stable in P1}.\n\ufffd For any G, \u03c1m(G) denotes the likelihood of G being a Galois-stable set under non-crisp agenda m. In FCA Galois-stability is interpreted tendency to form a meaningful category or concept definable both in terms of its intensions and extensions. Thus, for any G \u2286A, its stability index \u03c1m(G) denotes the probability of G forming a meaningful and stable category (or a concept). For any \u03b2 \u2208[0, 1], we define a \u03b2-categorization of objects: P(m, \u03b2) = {Cl(G) | G \u2286A, \u03c1m(G) \u2265\u03b2}. For any G with \u03c1m(G) \u2265\u03b2, the set RG contains the set of formal contexts in which G is Galois-stable. Therefore, P(m, \u03b2) denotes the categorization consisting of all the closed sets (i.e. sets of form Cl(G)) with stability index larger than \u03b2. The set P(m, \u03b2) under set-theoretic inclusion forms a lattice which can be used to depict the categorization P(m, \u03b2). This lattice can be interpreted as a crisp concept lattice representing the given (noncrisp) agenda m and stability parameter \u03b2. Unlike choosing the categorization with the highest probability categorization, this method takes into account opinions or information about other possible categorizations as well. The stability parameter \u03b2 allows us to choose our required stability threshold for a concept to be relevant. For any B \u2286A and X1 \u2286X we use B \u2208P1 = (A, X1, I \u2229A \u00d7 X1) to denote that B is a Galois-stable set in the context P1. Proposition 13. Let m : P(X) \u2192[0, 1] be a mass function representing an agenda. Let \u03b21, \u03b22 \u2208[0, 1] be such that \u03b21 \u2264\u03b22. Then for any B \u2286A, we have B \u2208P(m, \u03b22) implies B \u2208P(m, \u03b21). Proof. Let B \u2286A be such that B \u2208P(m, \u03b22). Then B = Cl(G) for some G \u2286A such that \u03c1m(G) \u2265\u03b22. As \u03c1m(G) \u2265\u03b22, we have \u03c1m(G) \u2265\u03b21. Thus, Cl(G) = B \u2208P(m, \u03b21). \u25a1 This result matches with the intuition that the lower value of \u03b2 means that our stability index threshold for considering a category or concept is lower and hence gives a finer categorization.\nRemark 14. By Proposition 3, if a set G \u2286A is Galois-stable in an induced context P1 = (A, X1, I \u2229A \u00d7 X1) for some X1 \u2286X, then it is Galois-stable in the context P = (A, X, I). Thus, a set which is not Galois-stable in P is not Galois-stable in any induced context and has stability index 0. Thus, for any \u03b2 > 0, and m we only need to check the Galois-stable sets in P to find sets with stability index greater than \u03b2 and hence to obtain categorization P(m, \u03b2). There have been several orderings defined on Dempster-Shafer mass functions. Definition 15 ([28, 16]). For any m1, m2 : P(X) \u2192[0, 1], 1. pl-ordering: m1 \u2264pl m2 iff for every Y \u2286X, pl1(Y) \u2264pl2(Y). 2. q-ordering: m1 \u2264q m2 iff for every Y \u2286X, q1(Y) \u2264q2(Y). 3. s-ordering: m1 \u2264s m2 iff there exists a square matrix S with general term S (W, Y), W, Y \u2286X verifying (\u2200Y \u2286X)(\ufffd W\u2286X S (W, Y) = 1, (\u2200W, Y \u2286X) S (W, Y) > 0 =\u21d2W \u2286Y) such that (\u2200W \u2286X)( m(W) = \ufffd  S (W, Y)m(Y)).\n3. s-ordering: m1 \u2264s m2 iff there exists a square matrix S with general term S (W, Y), W, Y \u2286X verifying (\u2200Y \u2286X)(\ufffd W\u2286X S (W, Y) = 1, (\u2200W, Y \u2286X) S (W, Y) > 0 =\u21d2W \u2286Y) such that (\u2200W \u2286X)( m1(W) = \ufffd Y\u2286X S (W, Y)m2(Y)).\n \ufffd 4.

That is, m1 \u2264\u2191m2.\n\ufffd \u2286 Notice preliminarily that, by the above, m1(W) = \ufffd W\u2286Y S (W, Y)m2(Y).

Suppose m1, m2 are agendas such that m1 \u2264\u2191m2. Then, for any G \u2286A, \u03c1m1(G) \u2264\u03c1m2(G). Proof. As m1 \u2264\u2191m2, we have m\u2032 1 \u2264\u2191m\u2032 2, where m\u2032 1 and m\u2032 2 are mass functions induced on R by m1 and m2 respectively. Let U \u2286R be any up-set in P(R). Then \ufffd P\u2208U m\u2032 1(P) \u2264 \ufffd P\u2208U m\u2032 2(P).\n(6.1)\n(6.3)\n\u25a1\nThat is, for any up-set U in P, p\u2032 1(U) \u2264p\u2032 2(U). Let RG be the set of formal contexts in which G is Galois-stable. As RG is an up-set by Corollary 4, \u03c1m1(G) = pm\u2032 1(RG) \u2264pm\u2032 2(RG) = \u03c1m2(G). \u25a1 Proposition 19. Let m1, m2 : P(X) \u2192[0, 1] be the mass functions defining two agendas. If m1 \u2264\u2191m2, then for any fixed \u03b2 \u2208[0, 1], and B \u2286A, if B \u2208P(m1, \u03b2), then B \u2208P(m2, \u03b2). Proof. Let B \u2286A be such that B \u2208P(m1, \u03b2). Then, there exists G \u2286A such that \u03c1m1(G) \u2265\u03b2 and Cl(G) = B. By Lemma 18, we have \u03c1m2(G) \u2265\u03b2. Thus, Cl(G) = B \u2208P(m2, \u03b2). \u25a1 Therefore, if m1 \u2264\u2191m2, for any fixed stability parameter \u03b2 \u2208[0, 1], the categorization obtained from m1 by the stability-based method is coarser than the one obtained from m2. As a smaller mass function in \u2264\u2191order corresponds to a more specific agenda, i.e. less amount of information being considered in categorization, it is reasonable that this gives a coarser categorization than a larger mass function in \u2264\u2191order. The following corollary is an immediate implication of Proposition 19, and property (6.3). Corollary 20. If m1, m2 are agendas and m1 \u2264s m2 (or m1 \u2264d m2), then, for any G \u2286A, \u03c1m1(G) \u2264\u03c1m2(G), and for any B \u2286A, B \u2208P(m1, \u03b2) implies B \u2208P(m2, \u03b2). The Proposition 19, and Corollary 20 can be considered as generalization of the Proposition 3 to the noncrisp case. The following corollary follows from Lemma 23, property (6.3), and Proposition 19 immediately. Remark 21. The Lemma 18, and Proposition 19 do not extend to q-ordering or pl-ordering. Let X = {y1, y2, y3}, and mass functions m1 and m2 be as follows. m1({y1, y3}) = 0.3, m1({y2, y3}) = 0.3, m1({y1, y2, y3}) = 0.2, m1({y3}) = 0.2, m2({y1, y3}) = 0.1, m2({y2, y3}) = 0.1, m2({y1, y2, y3}) = 0.5, m2({y3}) = 0.3. It is clear that m1 \u2264q m2 and m1 \u2264pl m2. However, for the up-set V = {{y1, y3}, {y2, y3}, {y1, y2, y3}} in P(X) \ufffd Y\u2208V m2(Y) < \ufffd Y\u2208V m1(Y).\n# 7 Deliberation and categorization in the non-crisp case\nLet j1 and j2 be two agents with non-crisp agendas m1 and m2 respectively. Let e1 = \u2293x\u2208X1x and e2 = \u2293x\u2208X2x. Let S be any coherent substitution relation. We consider some possible outcomes of deliberation between these agents.\n1. For any Y \u2286X, agenda after deliberation m is given by \ufffd\n\ufffd \ufffd 1\u22292\u2205 and m1 \u2295m2(\u2205) = 0. Note that the aggregation rule of deliberation is same as Dempster-Shafer combi tion.

An example of deliberation scenarios involving non-crisp agendas is presented in t Appendix.\n(7.1)\n(7.2)\n(7.3)\n(7.4)\nRemark 22. Note that deliberation scenarios 1-4 discussed above can be seen as non-crisp versions of the possible deliberation scenarios 1-4 in the crisp case discussed in Section 5. Indeed, if the mass functions have only one focal element (this corresponds to agenda being crisp) the aggregated mass functions obtained in scenarios 1-4 above are same as mass functions obtained in scenarios 1-4 in 5. Lemma 23. Let m1, m2 : P(X) \u2192[0, 1] be the mass functions representing two agendas. Let S be any substitution preference relation. Then 1. m \u2229m \u2264 m, m 2. m, m \u2264m \u222a m 3. m \u2229 m \u2264m \u222a m\n\ufffd \u2208V \ufffd \u2208V \ufffd \u2286 \ufffd \u2208V \ufffd \u222a \ufffd \u2208V The proof for m2 is obtained in identical manner. 3. For any Y1, Y2 \u2286X, Y1 \u2229Y2 \u2286Y1 \u222aY2. Therefore, for any up-set V, if Y1 \u2229Y2 \u2208V then Y1 \u222aY2 \u2208V Since, m1 \u2229S m2(Y) = \ufffd Y1\u2229Y2=Y m1(Z1)m2(Z2) and m1 \u222aS m2(Y) = \ufffd Y1\u222aY2=Y m1(Z1)m2(Z2), it immediately follows that \ufffd \ufffd\n  3. For any Y1, Y2 \u2286X, Y1 \u2229Y2 \u2286Y1 \u222aY2. Therefore, for any up-set V, if Y1 \u2229Y2 \u2208V then Y1 \u222aY2 \u2208V. nce, m1 \u2229S m2(Y) = \ufffd Y1\u2229Y2=Y m1(Z1)m2(Z2) and m1 \u222aS m2(Y) = \ufffd Y1\u222aY2=Y m1(Z1)m2(Z2),\nThus, for any non-crisp agendas m1 and m2 and any fixed stability parameter \u03b2 \u2208[0, 1], applying operation \u2229(resp. \u222a) leads to a categorization coarser (resp. finer) than either of the categorizations m1 or m2 and the categorization obtained from agenda m1 \u222aS m2 is finer than one obtained from m1 \u2229S m2 for any fixed. The Corollary 24 can be seen as a generalization of the Proposition 6 and Proposition 9 to the non-crisp case. We have described all the deliberation scenarios so far as occurring between two agents. However, same combination methods can apply to coalitions by combining their common or distributed agenda (depending on choice of the agents) similar to the agendas of individual agents. In such cases we may have additional possibilities of taking common or distributed agendas of a coalition as their agenda. Ignoring this increase in possibilities, the deliberation between coalitions can be treated in a manner similar to the deliberation between individual agents\n# Meta-Learning algorithms using interrogative ag\nSeveral outlier detection and classification algorithms based on FCA have been developed in recent times [19, 42, 31, 55, 63]. These algorithms are usually based on data analytic methods and are explainable, but, as the number of concept lattices grows exponentially with the number of features, feature selection methods need to render them usable. However, most feature selection methods do not allow for the representation of different importance of different features or sets of features4. In [1] we proposed a meta-algorithm which learns\n4Some algorithms allow for possibility of features having different importance but in our method we also allow for sets of features to have different importance value. This can be an important distinction when features have more structural relations among them.\n\u25a1\nan (non-crisp) agenda best suited for given outlier detection or classification task. The probability function induced on set of all categorizations by this agenda are used as estimation of relevance of this categorization to given task. A simple outlier detection or classification algorithm which acts on a single crisp concept lattice is used perform the task in each concept lattice with non-zero relevance. The final result of the meta-algorithm is obtained by combining results from all these concept lattices weighed by their relevance values. As total\nAlgorithm 1 Meta-Learning Algorithm for Interrogative Agendas\nInput: a set of objects A, a set of features X, a training set T \u2286X, and a map y : T \u2192C representing the labels on the training set, an\nalgorithm Alg that takes in input some object and a concept lattice in R, and outputs an element in RC representing its prediction for each\nclass; a loss function loss that compares two classifications and outputs a real number, and a number of training epochs M.\nOutput A model that classifies objects in X.\n1: procedure Train(A, X, T, y, Alg, loss, M)\n2:\nL1, . . . , Ln \u2190compute the concept lattices of R\n3:\nlet predictions be an empty map from A to RC\n4:\nlet w be an array of random weights of length n\n5:\nfor e = 1, . . . , M do\n6:\nfor a \u2208X, k \u2208C do\n7:\npredictions[a][k] \u2190\n\ufffdn\ni=1 w(Li)Algk(a,Li)\n\ufffdn\ni=1 w(Li)\n8:\nend for\n9:\nupdate w with an iteration of gradient descent (use loss)\n10:\nend for\n11: end procedure\nnumber of categorization in R is 2|X|, not all lattices in R can be considered in learning phase for practical reasons. This, we consider mass functions with a limited number of focal elements. The choice of focal elements is determined by the objectives and constraints of the algorithm. For simplicity, we allow weights in learning phase to be any real numbers. Interrogative agendas (mass functions) can be obtained by normalizing absolute values of these weights. Negative values assigned to certain set of features denote that the effect of results from this categorization is opposite to the overall task. For example, negative weight for a categorization in a classification task can signify that that not being in designated class in the categorization is evidence for being in the class under consideration in overall task. The agendas learned by the algorithm describe importance of different sets of features in the given task. This can be seen as a generalization of Shapely values [36], which estimate importance of individual features in given machine learning task. As agendas learned by algorithms can formally be seen as Dempster-Shafer mass functions, it is possible to use tools from Dempster-Shafer theory to study them. For example, different aggregation rules from Dempster-Shafer theory can be used to combine agendas learned from different algorithms to get an ensembled algorithm. Agendas learned with the algorithm can be compared or aggregated with the agendas of experts using Dempster-Shafer theory tools to allow for more collaborative environment between human experts and learning algorithms. This is especially important in fields like auditing where human supervision of algorithms is necessary for ethical and legal reasons. The learned agenda (weights) by the algorithm describe the importance of different sets of features for the algorithm. These agendas can be used for understanding what the algorithm considers to be important features for detecting outliers for interaction with human experts. In addition to this our algorithm also provides a local explainability where the outlier degree assigned to a single object can be interpreted by looking at the contribution of different categorizations to the final outlier degree assigned by algorithm. An implementation of this algorithm, its application to outlier detection, comparison with other outlier detection algorithms, and explanations provided by it are discussed in detail in [6]. In the future, we intend to carry similar study for the classification task.\n# 9 Conclusion and further directions\nMain contributions The main motivation behind this paper is the problem of categorizing business processes for auditing purposes, in a way that facilitates the identification of anomalies. Building on the insight that different ways of categorizing might lead to widely different results, in this paper, we investigate the space of possible categorizations of business processes, seen as nodes of one type in a bipartite graph. Formally, we obtain categorizations by seeing financial network which are formally (possibly weighted) bipartite graphs as formal contexts. We explore the space of the possible categorizations of a given set of business processes in\nterms of the interrogative agendas of a given set of agents. We use notions from modal logic to represent the interaction between different agents, agendas, and categorizations. We then discuss possible scenarios involving deliberation of different agents in deciding relevant features and make observations about possible outcomes (i.e. categorizations obtained from deliberation). We then generalize to the case when agendas of agents are non-crisp using Dempster-Shafer mass functions to denote the many-valued (non-crisp) agendas. We provide a novel stability-based method to obtain a crisp categorization approximating a fuzzy categorization corresponding to a non-crisp agenda. We also generalize different possible deliberation scenarios to the non-crisp case using Dempster-Shafer aggregation rules. We then show how our formal framework can be used to obtain machine learning algorithms for outlier detection and classification tasks which can provide both global and local explanations of results. This paper initiates a new line of research combining modal logic for describing and reasoning about agendas and interactions, FCA for modelling explainable categorizations, and Dempster-Shafer theory to reason with uncertainty. We believe that this contribution can be applied to a much wider range of problems than those involving financial transactions, and that it lays the groundwork of a framework for modelling categorizations involving different agents with different interests interacting and categorizing a set of objects. Below, we discuss some directions for future research.\n# Applications of different algorithms obtained from meta-algorithm to different fields The m\n1 can be used to obtain different interpretable machine leaning algorithms for outlier detection and classification. In future, we intend to study similarities and differences between such algorithms by applying them to different data sets from different fields. In particular, we are interested in application of such algorithms for anomaly detection in auditing. We believe that explanations provided by these algorithms and possibility to combine results with human expert knowledge using Dempster-Shafer theory makes this methodology specially attractive to auditors.\nMeta-algorithms for other FCA based tasks In Section 8 we discussed a meta-algorithm to obtain an interpretable machine learning algorithm for classification and outlier detection tasks. The meta-algorithm learns the agenda for given classification/outlier detection, that is it performs feature selection algorithm and also making it more explainable. Similar meta-algorithms can possibly be obtained for other tasks like, data-mining, information retrieval, attribute exploration, knowledge management where formal concept analysis is already being successfully applied [41, 43, 40, 21, 59] commonly performed using FCA. The specific instantiations of such algorithms can often be fine tuned to more efficient procedures. For instance, in the outlier detection algorithm, it is not necessary to use the usual generic FCA algorithms along with the meta-learning algorithm, but some optimized versions can be devised as just the closures of the singletons are needed. This insight that traditional machine learning and specialized fragments of FCA procedures can be used in synergy helps in mitigating the usually relatively high costs of these algorithms, while still while keeping a solid theoretical foundation of FCA.\nprovide information about relevance assigned to different sets of features by an algorithm. Agendas obtained from different algorithms can be compared or aggregated using Dempster-Shafer based methods [46, 26]. Agendas of human experts can also be combined or compared with agendas learned from algorithm in a similar manner.\nAxioms and rules for deliberation In Section 4.1 we mentioned coherence condition for substitution relation. In many practical situations, interactions between R, and S in deliberation may satisfy additional conditions. Many of these additional conditions can be axiomatised using modal logic. We may also add additional relations and modal operators to model relationships between different agents or dependencies between issues. These additional operators may satisfy some interactions axioms between themselves and the ones already considered here. Moreover, there may be several other possible deliberation scenarios than the ones discussed in this paper.\n# Declaration of interest and disclaimer:\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest, and declare that they have no relevant or material financial interests related to the research in this paper.

    "attri": {
        "background": "This paper addresses the issue of categorizing business processes in auditing, highlighting the limitations of existing methods in detecting anomalies due to the complexity of financial data represented as bipartite graphs. It emphasizes the necessity for a new framework that can better accommodate the diverse agendas of auditors to improve categorization outcomes.",
        "problem": {
            "definition": "The problem is the inadequate categorization of business processes in auditing, which leads to challenges in detecting both low-level and high-level anomalies in financial data.",
            "key obstacle": "The main obstacle is the reliance on traditional probability theory, which fails to address the uncertainties and complexities inherent in audit judgments, particularly in distinguishing between the absence of evidence and contrary evidence."
        },
        "idea": {
            "intuition": "The idea is inspired by the observation that experienced auditors rely on category formation to evaluate evidence, suggesting that a formal framework could enhance this process.",
            "opinion": "The proposed idea involves using Formal Concept Analysis and Dempster-Shafer theory to create a systematic approach for categorizing business processes based on various auditor agendas.",
            "innovation": "The innovation lies in integrating Dempster-Shafer mass functions with Formal Concept Analysis to allow for flexible categorization that reflects the varying importance of different financial accounts."

                "Aggregate the categorizations based on the deliberation among auditors."
            ],
            "principle": "The method is effective because it leverages the hierarchical structure of formal concepts to provide explainable categorizations that accommodate the varying relevance of financial accounts."
        },
        "experiments": {
            "evaluation setting": "The experiments are conducted using a dataset representing financial transactions structured as a bipartite graph, comparing the proposed method against traditional categorization techniques.",
            "evaluation method": "Performance is assessed through anomaly detection accuracy and the interpretability of categorizations, using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score."
        },
        "conclusion": "The proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in categorizing business processes, enhancing the detectability of anomalies while providing explanations that can assist auditors in their decision-making.",
        "discussion": {
            "advantage": "The key advantage is the ability to provide explainable categorizations that can adapt to the specific interests and agendas of different auditors, improving the overall auditing process.",
            "limitation": "A limitation of the method is its reliance on the quality of the bipartite graph representation, which may vary based on the underlying financial data.",
