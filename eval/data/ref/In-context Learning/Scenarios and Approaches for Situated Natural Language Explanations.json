The produced natural language explanations (NLEs)1 can be highly accu-\n1NLE is also termed \u201cfree-text rationales\u201d in literature: DeYoung et al. (2020); Joshi et al. (2023); Chen et al.

These desirable properties lead to wide potential applications that use LLMs as building blocks for explainer tools. The explainer tools are closely relevant to the users, which make some properties particularly desirable, for example, helpful for answering unseen instances (Joshi et al., 2023) and for fact-checking (Si et al., 2024). In this paper, we are particularly interested in situatedness: the explanations of the same phenomena can and should be tailored to the audience. This principle is well-established in the literature of psychology, education, and communication (e.g., the Cognitive Load Theory (van Merri\u00ebnboer and Sweller, 2005)), and is prevalent in writing guides (Purdue; Stephen et al., 2022; Cutts, 2020), even in government\u2019s writing guidelines (Administration, 2011).

However, their work only involves rule-based adaptation methods, and lacks a quantitative evaluation of the extent of such adaptation. In this paper, we aim to bridge both gaps. We introduce a novel benchmarking dataset called SITUATION-BASED EXPLANATION (SBE for short). This dataset contains 100 explananda (concepts or phenomena to be explained), each paired with three potential audiences. For each unique combination of explanandum and audience, we provide a human-written explanation, allowing us to compute similarity scores and a matching score that quantify how well the language models adapt the explanations to the target situations. Using SBE, we systematically evaluate the performance of various pretrained language models across three categories of prompting methods: rulebased prompting, meta-prompting, and in-context learning prompting. Through this analysis, we uncover the strengths and limitations of different prompting techniques in generating situated NLEs. Our key contributions are:\n# 1. We provide SBE, a dataset facilitating systematic study of the situated adaptation effects of NLE.\n2. We quantify the effects of several prompting techniques for generating situated explanations with LLMs.\nBy introducing SBE and rigorously evaluating the performance of various LLMs and prompting methods, this work paves the way for future research towards more effective and situationally appropriate natural language explanations.\n# 2 Related Work\nNatural language explanation Natural language explanations (NLEs) have been widely studied\nfor various high-level reasoning tasks, such as inference (Camburu et al., 2020), commonsense multiple-choice questions (Rajani et al., 2019), question-answering (Aggarwal et al., 2021), and product recommendations (Li et al., 2020). Wiegreffe and Marasovic (2021) provided a comprehensive review of datasets for NLEs, highlighting desirable properties of NLEs including simplicity (Lombrozo, 2007), clarity, and informativeness (Clinciu et al., 2021). We consider a different property: the extent of adaptation to the situational contexts of the explanations\u2019 readers.\n# Human-centered explanation Despite the nu\n# Human-centered explanation\nmerous methods proposed to make AI more explainable, most focus on mechanistic approaches, whose utilities are subject to increasing concerns that these methods fail to consider the cognitive and contextual needs of users. Multiple researchers have called for greater consideration of human factors when explaining AI (Liao et al., 2022; BoydGraber et al., 2022; Yeung et al., 2020; Miller, 2019; Ehsan et al., 2024; Goyal et al., 2023). Building upon this line of research, we develop NLE methods that are technically accurate and effectively communicate with and meet the needs of human users. Explainable recommendation is also a related research direction, where the personification of explanation would be beneficial for recommendation systems (Geng et al., 2022a,b). We consider a wide range of scenarios, and our findings can be applied to explainable recommendations.\nCultural and societal knowledge This paper is related to the works about the pragmatics of LMbased communication tools. Yerukola et al. (2024) considered the abilities to infer the speakers\u2019 intents. Rao et al. (2024) considered the cultural adaptabilities of LLMs. Liu et al. (2024) found that LLMs are less steerable when personified to stances associated with apparently incongruous traits. We focus on daily-life scenarios without the\ncross-cultural differences. Our work is also closely related to researches that assess the societal intelligence of LLM-based language generation systems, including Wang et al. (2024) which simulated societal interactions between LLM-based agents. We focus on the situated adaptation of NLE.\n# 3 Data\nWe identify 100 real-world scenarios across a broad spectrum of topics. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of categories in SBE. The categories include:\n\u2022 Lifestyle: Arts & culture, diaries & daily life, fashion & style, fitness & health, food & dining, other hobbies, sports, travel & adventure, youth & student life.\n# \u2022 Business & Tech: Business & entrepreneurs, science & technology.\n\u2022 Entertainment: Celebrity & pop culture, film, TV & video, gaming, music.\n\u2022 Education: Learning & educational.\n\u2022 News & Social Concern: News & social concern.\nFor each scenario, we pinpoint a central concept to be explained (explanandum) and crafted three distinct situations, each representing a potential audience with unique perspectives and concerns (desired feature). These audiences include foodies interested in exploring new and unique dishes, students navigating mental health challenges, and social media influencers looking to enhance their content engagement strategies. To ensure the validity of our benchmarks, we systematically develop a set of explanations for each scenario. To reflect the diverse needs and backgrounds of the specified audiences, explanations are manually written by our research team. We ensure that each explanation not only addresses the central concept but also resonates with the specific interests and concerns of the audience. This approach provides us with a rich dataset of explanations that are both contextually relevant and varied across different domains. Utilizing these carefully crafted explanations as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in generating situated NLEs.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/a644/a644cff9-3082-43eb-bccf-2607e9aa3e00.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: The distribution of categories in SBE.</div>\n# 4 Methods\n# 4.1 Rule-based prompting methods Base prompt\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">4.1 Rule-based prompting methods Base prompt</div>\n# 4.1 Rule-based prompting methods\nBase: {explanandum} because\nSpecify the audience or the desired feature\nWhereas previous work often limited prompting\nmodifications to either audience or context-specific\nfeatures, our approach combines both.

To further enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of our prompting techniques, we introduce a set of new templates that have been empirically tested to optimize the models\u2019 performance. These templates are designed to integrate seamlessly with the refined prompting strategies, ensuring that each prompt not only cues the model for content generation but also aligns closely with requirements of the situated NLE task.\n# 4.2 Meta prompt\nTo harness the capabilities of LLMs in generating contextually appropriate prompts, we employ a structured approach. This involves framing the prompt to explicitly include the intended audience and the specific features of interest, directing the model to tailor its response accordingly. Here is the format we propose for such prompts:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f1c8/f1c8c2c4-b8e6-44a7-ad36-c02293a5bd4a.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nIn our experiment, we tested prompts generated by GPT-3.5 on other models. Additionally, we evaluated each model\u2019s ability to generate its own prompts and then respond to them. This dual approach allowed us to not only assess the transferability of prompts across different models but also evaluate each model\u2019s capacity for self-driven contextual understanding and prompt formulation.\n# 4.3 In-context Learning Prompt\nIn-context learning prompts serve as a powerful tool to enhance a model\u2019s ability to generate context-specific explanations. The suggested format for in-context learning prompts for audience1 in one situation is:\nQ: Following is an explanation towards {audience2}, about {desired feature2}. {explanandum} because A: {explanation2} Q: Following is an explanation towards {audience3}, about {desired feature3}. {explanandum} because A: {explanation3} Q: Following is an explanation towards {audience1}, about {desired feature1}. {explanandum} because A:\nThe rationale for choosing the \"1AD2F3F\" template over others for the in-context learning prompt was guided by specific performance metrics observed in our initial testing phase. Specifically, the \"1AD2F3F\" template showed superior performance in terms of similarity scores and matching score when compared to other templates. The decision to focus on a single template, rather than attempting to replicate all possible templates in our demonstration setting, was based on practical constraints and the desire to optimize the demonstration\u2019s relevance and efficiency. Overall, we collect 16 prompts and evaluate performance of several LLMs on a situated NLE task by each prompt.\n# 5 Experiment setup\n# 5 Experiment setup 5.1 LLM explainers\n# 5.1 LLM explainers\nWe use 5 LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo (Ouyang et al., 2022), Pythia-2.8B (Biderman et al., 2023), LLaMa2-7B, LLaMa2-13B-chat (Touvron et al., 2023), and Yi-34B (AI et al., 2024), to generate situated NLEs.\n# 5.2 Evaluation\nIn our experiments, we focus on two key metrics: similarity score and matching score. The similarity score measures the semantic similarity between the generated explanation and the desired explanation for a given situation. Matching score evaluates the overall suitability of the generated explanation to the given situation.\nSimilarity score To measure the similarity between two sentences, we employ a sentence embedding model, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019a). Specifically, we use the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the sentencetransformers library (Reimers and Gurevych,\n2019b). The similarity between the two sentences is then computed as the cosine similarity between their embeddings. The score ranges from \u22121 to 1, with higher values indicating greater semantic similarity between sentences. A higher similarity score indicates an LLMgenerated explanation is more approximate to the human-annotated explanation in SBE. However, how ought one evaluate whether an LLM-generated explanation is suitable for the audience in the situation?\nMatching Score Within our evaluative framework, we adopt a scoring methodology predicated on the cross-entropy loss function to quantify the congruence between explanations generated by the LLM and the target explanations. The formula \ufffdN c=1 yc log(pc) delineates the computation of loss for a multi-class classification task, where N signifies the number of classes. Herein, the loss aggregates the weighted negative logarithms of the predicted probabilities pc across classes c, with the weighting provided by the actual class indicators yc. For the purpose of our experiment, we designate N = 3 to align with the triad of situational contexts within a singular scenario. Let c denote the situational index, and j represent the index for LLM-generated explanations. As we have 3 explanations generated by LLMs, j \u2208[1, 3]. Corresponding to each situation c, we associate the expert-annotated explanation hc, and for each LLM response j, the model-generated explanation ej. We calculate the similarity between hc and ej via the metric sim(hc, ej), with higher metric values indicating increased similarity. These similarity metrics are treated as unnormalized log probabilities (logits), to which we apply a softmax transformation for the derivation of probability values:\n\ufffd Subsequently, we impose the cross-entropy loss on the probabilities pcj to yield the matching score:\nIn this context, yc is assigned a value of 1 when the expert-annotated explanation hc corresponds with the LLM-generated explanation ej (i.e., when c = j), signifying a perfect match. In contrast, yc\nassumes a value of 0 for non-matching explanations. With cross-entropy loss and our 3-situationdesigned dataset, Matchingj in the equation quantitatively evaluate whether the LLM-generated explanation matches to the situation. Moreover, the cross-entropy loss Matchingj is minimized when the LLM-generated explanation matches the situation. Compared with the similarity score, the matching score enables a quantitative assessment of the LLM\u2019s explanation adequacy. Ultimately, the similarity score evaluates the degree to which explanations generated by the LLM align with human-annotated references, while the matching score quantifies the appropriateness of these explanations in their specific situational contexts.\n# 6 Results\nOur results demonstrate several key findings regarding the efficacy of different prompting techniques in generating situated NLEs. Specific results are provided in the appendix; Figure 5, 6.\n# 6.1 How do prompt techniques matter?\nFigure 3 shows the performance of each prompt techniques. Similarity score and matching score of 1A in the figure is the average score of explanations generated by prompt 1A2F3F, 1A2T3F, 1A2F3T, 1A2T3T and 7 LLMs(GPT-4-turbo, Gemini-pro, GPT-3.5-turbo, Pythia-2.8B, LLaMa27B, LLaMa2-13B-chat, and Yi-34B).\n# Specify the audience or the desired feature\nSpecifying both the audience and the desired feature(1AD) can lead LLMs to generate more suitable explanations comparing with only specify the audience(1A) or only specify the desired feature(1D). The technique specifying both audience and desired feature (1AD) yielded the best results, with an average similarity score of 0.634 and a matching score of 1.021, indicating that providing comprehensive contextual information significantly enhances model performance. Comparatively, specifying either the desire feature (1D) performs slightly better than specifying the desired feature (1A)(average similarity scores of 0.602 and 0.599, respectively, and matching scores of 1.040 and 1.046). This suggests that while each element alone provides some contextual grounding, their combination is more potent in guiding the model to generate relevant and precise explanations. Thus, we recommend to\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/8bac/8bac413d-0e1f-4dff-9485-5dc043a1966d.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 3: Average similarity and matching scores for all prompt techniques. \u2019M-GPT\u2019 refers to the use of GPT-3.5 turbo to generate prompts for situated NLE. \u2019Meta\u2019 refers to using the response model itself to generate prompts and respond to those. Note: A decrease in the matching score correlates with an enhancement in model performance on situated NLE tasks.\nspecify both the audience and the desired feature for a situated explanation.\nAdopt a persona The results show that the do not simulate the model as a helpful assistant (2F) approach yields a higher similarity score (0.635) compared to simulating the model as a helpful assistant (2T) (0.590), indicating that explanations generated without the persona are closer to human-annotated explanations. However, the matching score for 2T (1.034) is slightly better than for 2F (1.038), suggesting a marginally better alignment with the situational context when a persona is adopted. Despite this, the performance difference in matching scores is minimal, indicating that adding \"You are a helpful assistant\" to prompts for situated NLE tasks does not significantly aid the model\u2019s inferencing capability. Therefore, employing a persona in prompts is optional and may not be necessary for effective situated NLE generation.\n# Elicit the NLE with complete sentence\nresults highlight that use because (3F) method achieves a superior similarity score (0.6361) compared to use a complete sentence (3T) (0.5880), demonstrating that incorporating \"because\" in prompts helps the language model generate explanations that are significantly closer to those in SBE. Although 3T achieves a marginally better matching score (1.0289) than 3F (1.0427), this improvement is not substantial. Given the clearer advantage in similarity scores with 3F, we recommend using \"because\" in prompts for situated NLE tasks to more effectively align the generated explanations with the human-annotated standards.\nMeta prompt In our exploration of meta prompts, we observed that these did not perform as well as those generated through the 1AD method. A notable issue with meta prompts is their tendency to include additional, often unnecessary specifications that may not align with the situational needs. For example, meta prompts including \u201cDiscuss the potential consequences of this problem and the importance of addressing it\u201d introduce requirements that might not be relevant for the user. While maintaining fairness in our experimental evaluations, such specifics included in meta prompts led to their underperformance. This suggests that despite the innovative approach of using meta prompts, the traditional 1AD method remains more effective for generating situated natural language explanations aligned with the specific user contexts.\n# In-context learning prompt\nof in-context learning prompts with regard to similarity scores is exemplary, demonstrating a state-ofthe-art capability to replicate human-annotated explanations. Nonetheless, the performance in matching scores suggests that these prompts may not effectively aid the model in comprehending the situational context. This indicates a potential area for further refinement to enhance the model\u2019s situational awareness and its ability to generate contextually appropriate responses.\n# 6.2 How do different LLMs perform? As Figure 4 shows, the performance varies by LLM.\nWhy are GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro worse than GPT-3.5? Why are GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro con-\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/5999/59991571-367c-4f9f-b409-8ebd4db4eb17.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4: Average similarity and matching scores for all LLMs: \u2019P-2.8\u2019 represents Pythia-2.8B, \u2019L-7\u2019 stands for LLaMa-7B, \u2019L-13\u2019 is LLaMa-13B, and \u2019Y-34\u2019 indicates Yi-34B.

The explanations generated by GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro tend to be overly detailed, usually presented in a list format with up to seven points. (Appendix; Tabel 4, 5) This makes their explanations not only too lengthy but also excessively specific. For instance, the average length of a human-annotated explanation is about 29.5 words, while the average for GPT-4-generated explanations is 421.9 words, and for Gemini-Pro, it\u2019s 198.7 words. In contrast, GPT-3.5-generated explanations have an average length of 137.6 words. Consequently, the performance of GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro is deemed inferior under our evaluation metrics, as their lengthy and overly specific outputs do not align well with our human-annotated explanations.\nCommercial vs. open-source LLMs In our comparisons, models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini-Pro, which are developed with significant commercial backing, consistently outperform their open-source counterparts. These commerciallydeveloped models excel in generating more suitable, contextually appropriate explanations.\nVariations among open-source LLMs When examining open-source language models, particularly those within the same family or architecture, we observe that the performance differences are not as stark in terms of matching scores. However, in terms of similarity scores, there is a clear hierarchy: Pythia-2.8B < Yi-34B < LlaMa-7B < LlaMa13B. Although larger models generally show enhanced capabilities, suggesting that size contributes to model effectiveness, it is not the only factor influencing performance. Notably, LlaMa-7B and LlaMa-13B outperforms the larger Yi-34B model, indicating that factors beyond mere scale, such as model design, training protocol, or data quality, also play critical roles in determining a model\u2019s effectiveness. One the other hand, LlaMa-13B achieves better performance than LlaMa-13B. This result reinforces the idea that within a consistent architectural and training framework, larger models tend to demonstrate superior capabilities.\n# 7 Discussion\nVariance in Scenario Performance Our analysis reveals an interesting pattern in the variance of model outputs across different types of scenarios. Contrary to expectations, we find more variance among model outputs in scenarios related to daily life, which include a wide range of everyday activities and social interactions. This greater variance could be attributed to the inherent complexity and variability of such situations in daily life, which are less standardized and thus more challenging to simulate accurately. By contrast, scenarios in-\nvolving specialized domains such as technology, politics, and health exhibited less variance among the outputs from different models. These areas often involve more standardized and well-defined concepts and terminologies, which are easier for models to inference. As a result, language models appear to handle these topics with greater consistency, possibly due to the clearer and more uniform contexts provided in such scenarios.\n# 8 Conclusion\nBased on the task of situated natural language explanations, this paper introduces SBE, a novel benchmarking dataset including audiences with desired features in specific situations. We use quantitative methods to evaluate different prompts and different LLMs and we rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of various prompting techniques and the performance of diverse large language models using quantitative methods. Our findings not only demonstrate the strengths and limitations of current approaches but also prepare future research to enhance the adaptability and precision of automated explanations tailored to distinct user contexts.\n# Limitations\nWhile our study marks a significant advancement in the field of situated natural language explanations (NLEs) by introducing the SBE and demonstrating the adaptability of language models to various contexts, it inherently simplifies the complex reality of potential real-life situations. SBE, designed with three specific contexts per explanandum, offers a quantitative approach to evaluating model performance but does not encompass the near-infinite variety of scenarios shaped by diverse audiences and their unique needs. Consequently, the results, though robust within the defined parameters, may not fully capture model effectiveness in more dynamically varied or extensively nuanced real-world applications. Future research should focus on expanding the dataset to cover a broader spectrum of situations among different backgrounds and biases. Moreover, refining the models to enhance their adaptability to the multifaceted nature of reallife contexts should be considered.\n# Ethics Statement\nIn our research, we simulate hypothetical user situations to generate tailored explanations, which might, on LLM agents, trigger the use of personal\ndata if not deployed properly. The implication of deploying similar technology in real-world settings raises significant privacy concerns. Although our study does not entail these risks due to the nature of our data, future LLM agents must consider implementing stringent data protection measures. These should include robust anonymization techniques, minimal data retention policies, and adherence to privacy regulations to safeguard individual data rights. Additionally, as LLM-generated explanations become more convincing, they could be adversarially helpful (Ajwani et al., 2024). Approaches to defend adversarial helpfulness include asking the explainers to present information from multiple perspectives, which is relevant to adaptation. Last but not least, it is crucial to clarify that the explanations generated by our models are algorithmic outputs and do not reflect personal beliefs or empirical truths.\n# References\nGeneral Services Administration. 2011.

Educational technology can be meaningful because 4 ated nation Engaging and adaptive learning tools tailored to individual preferences are meaningful in educational technology because they help create personalized learning experiences that meet the unique needs and strengths of each student. Here are several reasons why these tools are particularly effective: \u2022 Personalization: Adaptive learning technologies can adjust the content, pace, and difficulty based on individual learning preferences and performance. This means students can learn in a way that is best suited to their own style and pace, which can help to foster deeper understanding and retention of knowledge. \u2022 Increased Engagement: Engaging learning tools are designed to capture and maintain students\u2019 interest through interactive elements such as games, quizzes, and interactive simulations. When students are engaged, they are more likely to invest time and effort in their learning, which can lead to better outcomes. \u2022 Accessibility and Inclusivity: Adaptive learning tools can also provide support for learners with diverse needs, including those with disabilities. For example, text can be converted to speech for students with visual impairments, or lessons can be structured in different ways to cater to various learning disabilities. This inclusivity ensures all students have an equal opportunity to learn and succeed. \u2022 Immediate Feedback: These tools often provide immediate feedback, which is crucial for learning. Students can understand what they\u2019re doing right and where they need improvement. This immediate response helps them to adjust their strategies and efforts in real time, promoting a more efficient learning process. \u2022 Data-driven Insights: Adaptive tools often collect data on student performance, which can be analyzed to provide insights into learning habits, difficulties, and progression. This information can be invaluable for teachers and educators to further tailor learning experiences, provide targeted support, and even refine curriculum and instructional strategies. \u2022 Scalability: Technology enables these personalized learning experiences to be scaled across large numbers of students without the same increase in resources that would be necessary if done manually by educators. This is particularly valuable in under-resourced or rural areas. \u2022 Skill Preparation: Modern educational tools prepare students for the technological world they will enter into after their education. By using tech-based tools in their learning process, students become proficient in digital literacy, a critical skill for almost all career paths in the modern workforce.\nTable 4: An explanation generated by GPT-4.\nFollowing is an explanation towards students, about engaging and adaptive learning tools tailored to individual preferences. Educational technology can be meaningful because Engaging and Adaptive Learning Tools Tailored to Individual Preferences Educational technology can be transformative when it provides students with personalized learning experiences tailored to their unique needs and preferences. By using engaging and adaptive tools, educators can create environments where students can thrive and achieve their full potential. Engaging Tools: \u2022 Interactive Simulations and Games: These provide immersive experiences that allow students to explore complex concepts in a fun and interactive way. \u2022 Virtual Reality (VR) Environments: VR headsets transport students to virtual worlds, allowing them to experience real-life scenarios and conduct experiments in a safe and controlled environment. \u2022 Social Collaboration Tools: Platforms that allow students to connect with peers, ask questions, and engage in group projects foster collaboration and enhance learning. Adaptive Tools: \u2022 Adaptive Learning Systems: These adjust course content and assessments to match the individual student\u2019s learning pace, skill level, and learning style. \u2022 Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS): ITSs provide personalized guidance and feedback to students, helping them identify areas for improvement and build on their strengths. \u2022 AI-Powered Language Tools: These tools assist students with writing and reading, providing real-time feedback on grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension. Tailored to Individual Preferences: These tools can be tailored to cater to different learning preferences: \u2022 Visual Learners: Simulations, VR environments, and interactive videos engage visual learners. \u2022 Auditory Learners: Audio-based lessons, podcasts, and recorded lectures cater to auditory learners. \u2022 Kinesthetic Learners: Hands-on activities, simulations, and collaborative projects provide opportunities for kinesthetic learners. Meaningfulness of Educational Technology: By providing students with engaging and adaptive learning tools tailored to their individual preferences, educational technology can make learning: \u2022 Personalized: Content and assessments are tailored to meet the specific needs of each student. \u2022 Motivating: Interactive and engaging tools keep students interested and motivated to learn. \u2022 Effective: Adaptive systems track student progress and provide personalized feedback to enhance learning outcomes. \u2022 Equitable: Technology provides all students with equal access to high-quality learning experiences, regardless of their background or learning style.\nTable 5: An explanation generated by Gemini-Pro.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/17d9/17d90192-b06e-4858-a85a-de32d6b5f9ff.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 5: Similarity score heatmap.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/e346/e346a2bd-242f-4607-953b-d6e7fbdb55d7.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n\n",
