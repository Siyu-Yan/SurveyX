Introduction\nIn formal language theory, Chomsky (Chomsky and Sch\u00fctzenberger (1959)) classified languages into four levels of increasing complexity. Associated to each level is a class of state machines, or automata, (Sipser (1996)) suitably complex to recognize languages at that level. At the lowest level are the finite state automata (FSA) which can recognize regular languages. At the next level, are the Pushdown automata (PDA) which are FSA augmented with a stack. These can recognize context-free languages. At the highest level are Turing machines, which are FSA augmented with a tape. These can recognize all computable languages.\nclg20@psu.edu\nAlthough technically Turing complete, recurrent neural networks are most analogous to FSAs, the least powerful in the hierarchy. To properly represent more powerful state machines, an additional memory architecture, representing at least the capabilities of a stack, is required. By combining two stacks into a tape, one can then reach the most general Turing Machine. A proper neural representation of a stack should have the following properties. \u2022 The representation should be differentiable: stack operations should be learnable by training on data and tuning weights using a standard gradient descent approach. \u2022 The representation should be natural: the architecture should insert the researcher\u2019s prior that a stack is appropriate for solving the problem at hand. \u2022 The representation should be stable: the architecture should faithfully represent a discrete stack after arbitrarily many operations despite the imperfection of learned parameters.\nAlthough technically Turing complete, recurrent neural networks are most analogous to FSAs, the least powerful in the hierarchy.

Das (Sun et al. (1998); Das et al. (1992)) proposed a natural differentiable stack. This stack maintained a sequence of blocks with variable size (ranging between 0 and 1) and read a combination of characters based on the set of blocks comprising the top of the stack. So, for example, after pushing 0.8 of character a and then pushing 0.9 of character b, the top of the stack would read 0.9b + 0.1a, with the remaining portion of a below the top of the stack. Then after popping with intensity 0.3, the top of the stack would read 0.6b + 0.4a. This representation is both differentiable and natural. But is it stable? Unfortunately it is not. Take, for example, a pair of push-then-pop operations, which should in theory leave the stack unchanged. If their intensities don\u2019t perfectly match, they leave the state of the stack permanently altered. For example, pushing 0.98 of a and then popping 0.97 leaves 0.01 of a left on the stack. After doing this 100 times, the top of the stack will then read a entirely, despite the fact that a was essentially popped just as many times as it was pushed. At this point, the stack no longer behaves at all like the discrete stack it was supposed to represent. This is an instability. More recent work on memory-augmented neural networks (Grefenstette et al. (2015); Joulin and Mikolov (2015); Mali et al. (2019); Graves et al. (2014, 2016)) provide computational approaches to differentiable stacks and tapes. For instance Joulin and Mikolov (2015) discretize and round their stack operator at test time to ensure it works stably on longer strings. Grefenstette et al. (2015) suffer a similar issue as Sun et al. (1998), and furthermore their approach relies on an assumption, rather than a proof, of stability. Other forms of NNs such as the Neural Turing Machine Graves et al. (2014) and the Differential neural computer Graves et al. (2016) suffer from similar stability issues. These models are well designed for a gradient descent approach to learning, but in no way can guarantee stability. Theoretically RNNs (Siegelmann and Sontag (1994)) and transformers (P\u00c3rez et al. (2021)) are Turing complete. However these representations are unnatural: the tape size depends on the precision of the floating point values and the tape cannot be distinguished from the rest of the architecture. This is also true for less powerful theoretical constructions (Korsky and Berwick (2019)) such as Gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks that are shown to be equivalent to PDA. Recently (Chung and Siegelmann (2021)) showed that a recurrent neural network with bounded neurons is Turing Complete and represents two stacks by encoding it\nDas (Sun et al. (1998); Das et al. (1992)) proposed a natural differentiable stack. This stack maintained a sequence of blocks with variable size (ranging between 0 and 1) and read a combination of characters based on the set of blocks comprising the top of the stack. So, for example, after pushing 0.8 of character a and then pushing 0.9 of character b, the top of the stack would read 0.9b + 0.1a, with the remaining portion of a below the top of the stack.

At this point, the stack no longer behaves at all like the discrete stack it was supposed to represent. This is an instability. More recent work on memory-augmented neural networks (Grefenstette et al. (2015); Joulin and Mikolov (2015); Mali et al. (2019); Graves et al. (2014, 2016)) provide computational approaches to differentiable stacks and tapes. For instance Joulin and Mikolov (2015) discretize and round their stack operator at test time to ensure it works stably on longer strings. Grefenstette et al. (2015) suffer a similar issue as Sun et al. (1998), and furthermore their approach relies on an assumption, rather than a proof, of stability.

However these representations are unnatural: the tape size depends on the precision of the floating point values and the tape cannot be distinguished from the rest of the architecture. This is also true for less powerful theoretical constructions (Korsky and Berwick (2019)) such as Gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks that are shown to be equivalent to PDA. Recently (Chung and Siegelmann (2021)) showed that a recurrent neural network with bounded neurons is Turing Complete and represents two stacks by encoding it\nwithin the growing memory module with discrete variables, but this representation is not differentiable. These constructions (Siegelmann and Sontag (1994); P\u00c3rez et al. (2021); Chung et al. (2014); Korsky and Berwick (2019)) do not guarantee stability with a differentiable operator. The contribution of this paper is the introduction of differentiable, natural, and stable automata based on a neural stack. The neural stack and its associated parametrized stack operator lie at the core of this paper. Once the stack is shown to be stable, the nnPDA is introduced as a recurrent neural network together with the neural stack. Finally, a tape is represented as two neural stacks joined end-to-end and used to introduce the nnTM. Crucially, the stability implies that these automata can handle arbitrarily long strings, which is not valid for other theoretical results (Chung et al. (2014); P\u00c3rez et al. (2021); Siegelmann and Sontag (1995) or computational models Sun et al. (1998); Graves et al. (2014); Mali et al. (2020b); Joulin and Mikolov (2015)). This is an essential property for designing neuro-symbolic architectures, especially when extending to out-of-distribution samples. Finally, we observe in light of the Universal Turing Machine (UTM) work of Neary and Woods (2007) that a small number (such as seven) of bounded neurons are required to simulate any TM with this architecture.\n# 2. Related Work\nHistorically, grammatical inference (Gold (1967)) has been at the core of language learnability and could be considered to be fundamental in understanding important properties of natural languages. A summary of the theoretical work in formal languages and grammatical inference can be found in (De la Higuera (2010)). Applications of formal language work have led to methods for predicting and understanding sequences in diverse areas, such as financial time series, genetics and bioinformatics, and software data exchange (Giles et al. (2001); Wieczorek and Unold (2016); Exler et al. (2018)). Many neural network models take the form of a first order (in weights) recurrent neural network (RNN) including Long short term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and other variants and have been taught to learn context free and context-sensitive counter languages (Gers and Schmidhuber (2001); Das et al. (1992); Bod\u00e9n and Wiles (2000); Tabor (2000); Wiles and Elman (1995); Sennhauser and Berwick (2018); Nam et al. (2019); Wang and Niepert (2019); Cleeremans et al. (1989); Kolen (1994); Cleeremans et al. (1989); Weiss et al. (2018)). However, from a theoretical perspective, RNNs augmented with an external memory have historically been shown to be more capable of recognizing context free languages (CFLs), such as with a discrete stack (Das et al. (1993); Pollack (1990); Sun et al. (1997)), or, more recently, with various differentiable memory structures (Joulin and Mikolov (2015); Grefenstette et al. (2015); Graves et al. (2014); Kurach et al. (2015); Zeng et al. (1994); Hao et al. (2018); Yogatama et al. (2018); Graves et al. (2016); Le et al. (2019); Mali et al. (2019, 2020a)). Despite positive results, prior work on CFLs was unable to achieve perfect generalization on data beyond the training dataset, highlighting a troubling difficulty in preserving long term memory (Sennhauser and Berwick (2018); Mali et al. (2020b, 2021a,b); Suzgun et al. (2019)). This is also true for other sequential models such as Transformers Bhattamishra et al. (2020), since they are restricted due to other positional encoding and cannot go beyond a sequence length. Theoretically self-attention which is a core element for recent success behind\ntransformers based variants cannot even recognize CFLs even using infinite precision (Hahn (2020)) in weights. Prior work (Omlin and Giles (1996c)) have shown that due to instability issues neural networks can struggle in recognizing simplest grammars such as regular grammars when tested on longer strings. Given RNNs acts which should be the same for states in a stack RNN learning a PDA since a PDA is DFA controlling a stack. Early work primarily focused on constructing DFA in recurrent networks with hard-limiting neurons (Alon et al. (1991); Horne and Hush (1994); Minsky (1967), sigmoidal Omlin and Giles (1996c); Giles and Omlin (1993); Omlin and Giles (1996b,a) and radial-basis functions Alqu\u00e9zar and Sanfeliu (1995); Frasconi et al. (1992)). The importance and equivalence of differentiable memory over a discrete stack while learning is still unclear (Joulin and Mikolov (2015); Mali et al. (2020a)). Recently, (Merrill et al. (2020)) theoretically studied several types of RNNs and transformers analyzed there capability to understand various classes of languages with finite precision and time. In this paper we provide a new theoretical bound and show nnTM is Turing complete with bounded/finite precision and time.\n#  Vector Representation of a Pushdown Automato\nThe state machine responsible for recognizing a context free grammar (CFG) is a pushdown automaton (PDA). In this section, we review the PDA and describe how it can be represented using vector and tensor quantities, which are analogous to weights in a neural network. A pushdown automaton is a deterministic finite state automaton (DFA) that controls a stack.Hopcroft et al. (2006) We review the DFA in \u00a73.1, the stack in \u00a73.2, and the PDA in \u00a73.3. An example CFG and a vector representation of a corresponding PDA is provided in \u00a73.4.\n# 3.1 The Deterministic Finite-State Automaton (DF\nHere, we review the DFA and provide a vector representation. First we show classical version of DFA which is adopted from the prior work. We then introduce dynamic version and vector representation, which is much closer to state transition for the sequential models such as RNNs. Formally, a DFA is defined as a 5-tuple, which is represented as follows:\nDefinition 3.1. (DFA, classical version) A deterministic finite state automaton is a quintuple (Q, \u03a3, \u03b4, q0, F), where Q = {q1, ..., qn} is a finite set of states, \u03a3 = {a1, ..., am} is a finite alphabet, \u03b4 : Q \u00d7 \u03a3 \u2192Q is the state transition function, and q0 \u2208Q is a start state, F \u2282Q is a set of acceptable final states.\nDefinition 3.1.

A string of l characters a1...al can be fed to the DFA, which in turn changes state according to the following rules.\nA string of l characters a1...al can be fed to the DFA, which in turn changes state according to the following rules.\nAs we are mainly interested in dynamics, we will work in the context of an arbitrary string. The following simplified definition focuses on the dynamics of the DFA which will be useful in creating a connection between DFA state transition and RNN state transition.\nwhere \u03b4t+1(q) = \u03b4(q, at+1).\nwhose components \u00afQti are\n \u0338 The next state vector \u00afQt+1 is given by the dynamic relation \u00afQt+1 = W t+1 \u00b7 \u00afQt,\nwhere the transition matrix W t+1, determined by the transition tensor W and the input vector It+1, is W t+1 = W \u00b7 It+1.\nThe input vector It+1 \u2208{0, 1}m has components\nand the transition tensor W has components\nIn component form, the dynamic relation can be rewritten as\nThe reader may wish to check that all three definitions are consistent with each other.

They act on strings in \u0393\u2217according to the following rules.\nTo easily generalize to a neural network, we will modify the above stack definition to obtain a vector representation.\nDefinition 3.7. (Stack, vectorized version) Let\nB { be the canonical basis of Rm2. A stack \u00afK is a vector-valued sequence\n {}  \u2208B \u222a{} with the additional requirement that there exists an integer s, called the stack size, such that \u00afKi \u2208B(m2) i < s\nand\n \u2264 The vector-valued sequence \u00afK can be determined from a stack state k \u2208\u0393\u2217by setting \u00afKi to be the one-hot encoding of the ith character r((\u03c0\u2212)ik) of k, using \u20d70 to represent e. For the vectorized stack, we group all the stack operators into a single parametrized operator as defined here. Definition 3.8. (Parametrized stack operator) For any scalar pair (\u00afp+, \u00afp\u2212) \u2208{(1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)}\n\u2212\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212 It is worth verifying that according to the above definition, the operator \u00af\u03c0(1, 0, \u00afC) pushes the vector \u00afC onto the stack, the operator \u00af\u03c0(0, 1, \u00afC) pops the stack, and the operator \u00af\u03c0(0, 0, \u00afC) is the identity operator. In tensor products that will be used momentarily, if any factor is zero, the entire expression becomes zero. Therefore, instead of using the top of the stack \u00afK directly, we will instead use the stack reading vector \u00afR, which has one additional component that is 1 when \u00afK0 = \u20d70 and 0 otherwise. Definition 3.9. (Stack Reading) Given the top vector of the stack \u00afK0 with dimension m2, we define the stack reading vector \u00afR to be a vector of dimension m + 1, with components\nDefinition 3.9.

The following definition of a PDA closely resemble Hopcroft\u2019s definition. Hopcroft et al. (2006)3\nDefinition 3.10. (PDA, classical version) A pushdown automaton is a 7-tuple (Q, \u03a3, \u0393, \u03b4, q0, e, F where Q = {q1, ..., qn} is a finite set of states, \u03a3 = {a1, ..., am1} is the finite input alphabet, \u0393 = {b1, ..., bm2} is the finite stack alphabet, \u03b4 : Q \u00d7 \u03a3 \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192Q \u00d7 op(\u0393) is the transition function with op(\u0393) being the set of stack operators from Definition 3.6, q0 \u2208Q is the start state, e is the stack error character, and F \u2282Q is a set of acceptable final states. Let \u03b4Q : Q \u00d7 \u03a3 \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192Q and \u03b4op : Q \u00d7 \u03a3 \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192op(\u0393) represent the first and second part of the transition function \u03b4. Let q \u2208Q and k \u2208\u0393\u2217. A string of l characters a1...al can be fed to the PDA, which changes state and stack state according to the following rules.\nAs we are mainly interested in dynamics, we will work in the context of an arbitrary string. The following simplified definition focuses on the dynamics of the PDA. Definition 3.11. (PDA, dynamic version) At any time t, the state of a pushdown automaton\n \u2208{} \u00d7 The next state (qt+1, kt+1) is given by the dynamic relations\nwhere \u00afQt is a one-hot vector encoding the state qt as in Definition 3.3 and \u00afKt is a vect encoding of the stack kt according to Definition 3.7.

The following example may be helpful.\n# 3.4 An Example PDA\nFor illustrative purposes, we give an example here of a vectorized PDA for the grammer of balanced parentheses. The goal is to classify strings with characters \u2018(\u2019 and \u2018)\u2019 based on whether they close properly. So for example, the strings \u201c()\u201d, \u201c(())\u201d, and \u201c(()())\u201d are valid, while the strings \u201c)\u201d, \u201c(()\u201d, and \u201c(()))\u201d are invalid. To avoid confusion, we\u2019ll use L to represent the left parenthesis \u2018(\u2019 and R to represent the right parenthesis \u2018)\u2019, and introduce E to represent the end of the string. With these representations, the example valid strings are represented by LRE, LLRRE, and LLRLRRE, while the example invalid strings are represented by RE, LLRE, and LLRRRE. For tensors W with indices j, k, and l, the j index is paired with state input. Our PDA will have n = 2 states representing either acceptable \ufffdor rejected \ufffd. We will represent these with two dimensional vectors the following way.\nFor tensors W with indices j, k, and l, the k index is paired with the input characte Since the input character alphabet has size m1 = 3, we will represent the input characters a vectors the following way.\n\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8 Finally, for tensors W with indices j, k, and l, the l index is paired with the stack reading vector. Our stack alphabet has size m2 = 1 as a single character must be pushed each time L is encountered and popped each time R is encountered. Although the stack vector has\ndimension m2 = 1, the reading from stack has dimension m2 + 1 = 2, with the addition dimension representing an empty stack reading. The possible stack reading vectors are a follows. \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\ndimension m2 = 1, the reading from stack has dimension m2 + 1 = 2, with the additional dimension representing an empty stack reading. The possible stack reading vectors are as\n3.4.1 State Transition Rules\n# 3.4.1 State Transition Rules\nGiven a stack reading and input character, which fix l and k indices respectively, the i and j components of the transition tensor (WQ)ijkl can be interpreted as entries in an adjacency matrix that acts on the input state vector to give the output state vector. If L is encountered, we should not change state. Thus,\nIf R is encountered, then we should not change state unless the stack is empty, in which case we should change from \ufffdto \ufffd. Thus,\nFinally, if E is encountered, then we should not change state unless the stack is non-empty, in which case we should change from \ufffdto \ufffd. Thus,\n3.4.2 Stack Action Rules\nThe only case where we push is when encountering L. Thus,\nAlternatively, if we only which to specify a character when pushing, we may instead set\nEither way, the index i must take the value 0 as the stack alphabet has size m2 = 1.\n# 4. Neural Network with Stack Memory\nThis section is the heart of the paper. In \u00a74.1, we define the differentiable stack, and then in \u00a74.2, we use it to define the neural network pushdown automaton (nnPDA). Finally, in \u00a74.3, we prove that the nnPDA stably approximates the PDA. We will use the logistic sigmoid function\nas an activation function. Note that hH(0) = 1 2 and hH(x) decreases to 0 as Hx \u2192\u2212\u221eand increases to 1 as Hx \u2192\u221e. The scalar H is a sensitivity parameter. In practice, we will often show that x is bounded away from 0, and then assume H to be a positive constant sufficiently large so that hH(x) is as close as desired to either 0 or 1, depending on the sign of the input x. (See Lemma 4.7.) The reader may notice that a few proofs vaguely require that H be sufficiently large. By taking the maximum of all lower bounds for H required by each proof, we may arrive at a value for H that satisfies all of these requirements simultaneously. Furthermore whenever we refer differentiable operator is closer to ideal/discrete operator or approximates the operator, we refer to fixed point mapping or asymptotic stability. Fixed point of mapping function is defined as follows: Definition 4.1. Let us assume f : Z \u2192Z be a mapping on metric space. Thus a point zf \u2208 Z is called a fixed point of the mapping such that f(zf) = zf To achieve this we define stability of zf as follows: Definition 4.2. A fixed point zf is considered stable if there exists an range R = [i, j] \u2208Z such that zf \u2208R and iterations for f starts converging towards zf for any starting point zs \u2208 R. The continuous function Z \u2192Z as the following useful property. Theorem 4.3. (BROUWER\u2019S FIXED POINT THEOREM) (Boothby (1971)) Under a continuous mapping function f : Z \u2192Z there exists at least one fixed point.

(1997); Grefenstette et al. (2015); Joulin and Mikolov (2015). Definition 4.4. (Differentiable stack) For a stack alphabet of size m2, a differentiable stack K is a vector-valued sequence K = {K0, K1, ...}, Ki \u2208[0, 1]m2, with the additional requirement that there exists an integer s, called the stack size, such that Ki = \u20d70 for all i \u2265s.\nHere we define a differentiable stack memory Sun et al. (1997); Grefenstette et al. (2015); Joulin and Mikolov (2015). Definition 4.4. (Differentiable stack) For a stack alphabet of size m2, a differentiable stack K is a vector-valued sequence\n((\u03c0(p+, p\u2212, C)K)i=0)j = hH \ufffd p+Cj + p\u2212(K1)j + (1 \u2212p+ \u2212p\u2212)(K0)j \u22121 2 \ufffd .\nThis is visualized in Figure 1. Note that the operator \u03c0(0, 1, C) is an differentiable pop operator, the operator \u03c0(0, 0, C) is an differentiable identity operator, and the operator \u03c0(1, 0, C) is an differentiable push operator that pushes the vector C onto the stack, such that differentiable stack operator are nearly equal to ideal stack operators. Recall Definition 3.8, wherein a similar idealized operator \u00af\u03c0(\u00afp+, \u00afp\u2212, \u00afC) is defined, for which \u00af\u03c0(0, 1, \u00afC) is exactly a pop operator, the operator \u00af\u03c0(0, 0, C) is the identity operator, and the operator \u00af\u03c0(1, 0, \u00afC) is exactly a push operator that pushes the vector \u00afC onto the stack. The relation between these two operators is formalized by the following proposition, which serves as a theoretical justification for \u03c0(p+, p\u2212, C).\nProposition 4.6. (\u03c0(\u00b7, \u00b7, \u00b7) approximates \u00af\u03c0(\u00b7, \u00b7, \u00b7)) Let K be a stack according to Definition 4.4 and let \u00afK be an idealized stack according to Definition 3.7, and suppose that\nLet \u03c0(p+, p\u2212, C) be an operator according to Definition 4.5 and \u00af\u03c0(\u00afp+, \u00afp\u2212, \u00afC) be an idealized operator according to Definition 3.8. Suppose furthermore that, in addition to belonging to the domains of their respective operators, the quantities p+, p\u2212, C, \u00afp+, \u00afp\u2212, and \u00afC satisfy\n|| \u2212||\u2264 f \u03f5 is sufficiently small, then H can be chosen sufficiently large, depending only on \u03f5, so that sup ||(\u03c0(p+, p\u2212, C)K)i \u2212(\u00af\u03c0(\u00afp+, \u00afp\u2212, \u00afC) \u00afK)i||L\u221e\u2264\u03f5.\nTo simplify the proof of this proposition, we will first state and prove two lemmas. The first lemma says that if a vector is within a fixed point of its corresponding idealized vector 4, then applying the activation function will make the resulting vector very close to the idealized vector. (This requires a suitably large choice of the sensitivity parameter.)\nFigure 1: Differentiable Stack Operation Visualization of the operator \u03c0(p+, p\u2212, C) with p+ = 0.7 and p\u2212= 0.2.

By applying the weights WQ, WC, Wp+, Wp\u2212, it computes and outputs the new state represented by Qt+1 as well as the parameters for the stack action, represented by Ct+1, pt+1 + , and pt+1 \u2212. The stack is then updated by applying the operator \u03c0(Ct+1, pt+1 + , pt+1 \u2212).

Theorem 4.12.

But in particular, we note that the work in this paper does not require unbounded precision and time.\nTheorem 4.14. For any given Pushdown Automaton (PDA) M with n states and m stac symbols, there exists a differentiable nnPDA with n+1 bounded precision neurons that can simulate M in real-time.\n# 5. Neural Network with Tape Memory\nIn this section, we generalize the work done in the previous section from Pushdown Automata to Turing Machines. Most of the heavy lifting has already been done at this point\u2013our approach will be to represent a tape, the memory associated with a Turing Machine, as a pair of stacks.\n# 5.1 The Tape\nA Turing Machine is a DFA augmented with a tape. The following definition closely follows Hopcroft et al. (2001).\nDefinition 5.1. (Turing Machine, classical version) A Turing machine is a 7-tuple defined as: M = \u27e8Q, \u0393, b, \u03a3, \u03b4, qs, F\u27e9, where Q = {q1(= qs), q2, . . . , qn} is the set of finite states, \u0393 = {s0, s1, . . . , sm} is the input alphabet set including b = s0, \u03a3 is a finite set of tape symbols, \u03b4 : \u0393\u00d7Q \u2192\u0393\u00d7Q\u00d7op(\u0393) is the transition function or rule for the grammar, qs \u2208Q is the initial starting state and F \u2282Q is the set of final states.\nThe instantaneous configuration of a Turing Machine is typically defined as a tuple of state, tape, and the location of the read/write head. Typically, the tape is described as an array of characters without end on either side and the head as a signed index into this array. To take advantage of the work done in the previous section, we prefer an alternate representation in which the tape is split into two stacks, the right stack and the left stack. The right stack, denoted as k, consists of all symbols on the tape under or to the right of the head. The left stack, denoted as l, consists of all symbols left of the head. The top of each stack is the closest to the tape head and the blank symbols of the tape on both sides are omitted as they would be below the bottom of either stack. Although it is clear the stack pair encodes the memory of a tape, in order to ensure that the it properly represents a tape, we must pay careful attention to the operations we apply to each stack simultaneously.\nop(\u0393) = {\u03c9\u2212(b1), ..., \u03c9\u2212(bm2), \u03c90, \u03c9+}.\nThese operators have the following effect on the tape: \u03c9\u2212(c) writes c and then moves the head to the right, \u03c90 has no effect, and \u03c9+ moves the head to the left.\nIn particular, note that while the stack operators parametrize \u03c0+ and have a single \u03c0\u2212, instead for the tape operators \u03c9+ and \u03c9\u2212, this is reversed. There is an asymmetry here\u2013we must pick one stack to have its top lie under the head. By convention, we choose to have the head read from k to be consistent with the PDA. We would also like \u03c9\u2212to act on k the same way \u03c0\u2212acts on k and \u03c9+ the same way as \u03c0+. But for this to happen, we must parametrize \u03c9\u2212instead of \u03c9+. Otherwise, there would be no way to read from l. Instead, we indirectly read from the left stack when applying \u03c0+ to k. The operators \u03c9\u2212(c), \u03c90, and \u03c9+ act on a double-stack tape the following way.\nWith the stack pair representation of a tape, it is now straightforward to generalize to a differentiable tape using the work developed in the previous section.\nWith the stack pair representation of a tape, it is now straightforward to generalize to a differentiable tape using the work developed in the previous section. Definition 5.3. (Differentiable tape) A differentiable tape is a pair of differentiable stacks (K, L), each as defined in Definition 4.4. The stack K is called the right stack and the stack L is called the left stack. The head of the tape reads K0, the top of the stack K. The following is the differential analogue of the operator \u03c9. Definition 5.4. (Differentiable tape operator) For scalars p+, p\u2212and vector C \u2208[0, 1]n, we define the tape operator \u03c9(p+, p\u2212, C) as follows.\nDefinition 5.4. (Differentiable tape operator) For scalars p+, p\u2212and vector C \u2208[0, 1]n, we define the tape operator \u03c9(p+, p\u2212, C) as follows.\n\u03c9(p+, p\u2212, C)(K, L) = (\u03c0(p+, p\u2212, L0)K, \u03c0(p\u2212, p+, C)L).\nNote in particular that the arguments p\u00b1 for the operator acting on L are reversed, and the operator acting on K has the top of the left stack as its third argument. This way, \u03c9(1, 0, C), \u03c9(0, 0, C), and \u03c9(0, 1, C) approximate \u03c9+, \u03c90, and \u03c9\u2212(c) respectively. We now fully define the nnTM architecture. This is directly analogous to Definition 4.11.\n(6) (7) (8)\nDefinition 5.5. (nnTM) At any time t, the full state of a neural network Turing Machin is represented by the triplet\nwhere Qt \u2208[0, 1]n is a vector encoding the state and Kt and Lt are stacks representing respectively the right and left part of a differentiable tape according to Definition 5.3. The next state pair (Qt+1, Kt+1, Lt+1) is given by the dynamic relations \ufffd \ufffd\nwhere the transition matrix W t+1 Q and operator \u03c9t+1 are defined as follows. Letting It+1 be a one-hot encoding of the (t + 1)th input character, the transition matrix W t+1 Q is given in component form by\nwhere the components (WQ)ijkl are chosen to represent the transition rules as in Definition 3.12, and the stack reading Rt is determined from Kt 0 as described by Definition 4.9.

The following theorem now follows from Theorem 4.12 and our formulation of the Turing Machine as a machine with two stacks. Theorem 5.6. Let It be an arbitrary time-indexed sequence encoding a character string, let (Qt, Kt, Lt) be a state-and-tape sequence governed by equations (9-10) in Definition 5.5 for some scalar H, and let ( \u00afQt, \u00afKt, \u00afLt) be an idealized state-and-tape sequence representing a vectorized Turing Machine. For any \u03f5 > 0 sufficiently small, if H is sufficiently large (depending on \u03f5) and (Qt=0, Kt=0, Lt=0) = ( \u00afQt=0, \u00afKt=0, \u00afLt=0),\nthen for all t \u22650,\n||Qt \u2212\u00afQt||L\u221e\u2264\u03f5, sup i ||Kt i \u2212\u00afKt i||L\u221e\u2264\u03f5, sup i ||Lt i \u2212\u00afLt i||L\u221e\u2264\u03f5.\n(9) 10)\nTheorem 5.8. (Neary and Woods (2007)) Given a deterministic single tape Turing machine M that runs in time t then any of the above UTMs can simulate the computation of M using space O(n) and time O(t2).\nTheorem 5.9. A nnTM with n = 6 states and m = 4 tape symbols can stably simulate any TM in O(t2) time.\n# 6. Discussion and Complexity\nThe operations performed by our tensor nnTM directly map to TM state transitions, making the TM encoding straightforward. For a state machine with n states, an input alphabet of size m1, a tape alphabet of size m2, and a tape with maximum capacity s, we show how to construct a sparse recurrent network with n + 1 state neurons, O(m1m2n(m1 + m2 + n)) weights and a tape memory footprint of size O(sm2), such that the TM and constructed network accept recursively enumerable languages.\n# 7. Conclusion\nWe defined a vectorized stack memory and a parameterized stack operator that behaves similarly to stack push/pop operations for particular choices of parameters. We used these to construct a neural network pushdown automaton (nnPDA). We showed that our construction\nis stable: for suitable choices of weights, the nnPDA will closely resemble a corresponding PDA for arbitrarily long strings. (The sense in which the nnPDA and PDA are close is formalized by representing both as vectors and taking the vector difference.) We then represent a tape as a pair of stacks and adapt our parametrized memory operator, thereby extending our result to a neural network Turing Machine (nnTM) as a stable approximation of a Turing Machine. We observe that, in light of work by Neary and Woods (2007), this means a nnTM architecture with n = 6 states and m = 4 tape symbols can simulate any TM.\n# References\n",
