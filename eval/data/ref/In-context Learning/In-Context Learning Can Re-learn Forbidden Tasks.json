Introduction\nWith the ever growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) comes an increasing concern about how to make them safe (Touvron et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022) and prevent bad behaviours (Amodei et al., 2016). Examples of bad behaviour include: reward hacking (Pan et al., 2022), whereby the model exploits the specification of the training\n1Mila \u2013 Qu\u00b4ebec AI Institute 2Universit\u00b4e de Montr\u00b4eal 3HEC Montr\u00b4eal 4Canada CIFAR AI Chair.

These issues, together with the model\u2019s power to create harmful outputs, have created a need for safety research to prevent malicious behaviours like hallucination and answering harmful queries. The most common training pipeline for creating safe and helpful LLMs is to take a pre-trained base model that was optimised on the next token prediction and to fine-tune it to be helpful and safe (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; OpenAI et al., 2023). This fine-tuning typically involves applying a mixture of techniques on high-quality data from user chat examples, human preference data, or data generated by high-quality models. The techniques used are numerous, but the most common ones include instruction fine-tuning (Longpre et al., 2023), reinforcement learning methods such as proximal policy optimisation (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) together with reward modelling (Bai et al., 2022), or direct preference optimisation (Rafailov et al., 2023). However, as a model is fine-tuned to be safer, it can become less helpful or effective at other tasks, necessitating a careful balance with the techniques and the data used. However, it remains a key challenge to evaluate whether these \u201csafety fine-tuning\u201d approaches sufficiently minimize harm, especially against determined users. Conventionally, claims like the robustness or reliability of a deep learning model against an adversary are evaluated with adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al., 2014; Carlini & Wagner, 2017). Currently, in natural language processing (NLP) there is no agreed upon threat model unlike other fields such as computer vision (Akhtar & Mian, 2018) where the perturbations to the input image have to be very small. A possible threat-model allows the attacker full access to the model\u2019s internals, including the weights. With access to the weights, the attacker may use the model gradients to optimize the token in a prompt that would bypass the model\u2019s safety guardrails and cause it to output harmful content (Zou et al., 2023). While conventional adversarial attacks provide evidence\nobjective to achieve a good score in an undesirable manner; presenting made up statements as facts (Branco et al., 2021; Guerreiro et al., 2023) also known as hallucinating or confabulating (Millidge, 2023; Bottou & Sch\u00a8olkopf, 2023); or answering queries that lead to harmful behaviours such as generating toxic content (Zou et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2023). These issues, together with the model\u2019s power to create harmful outputs, have created a need for safety research to prevent malicious behaviours like hallucination and answering harmful queries.\nWhile conventional adversarial attacks provide evidence\nabout the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of safety fine-tuning, because they requires access to the model internals, we are less concerned that malicious users would use these approaches as an actual means of attack. However, another (potentially emergent) behavior of LLMs\u2014their ability to learn in-context (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Olsson et al., 2022)\u2014might be a vulnerability. In-context learning, also known as few-shot prompting, involves learning to predict the next token for an unseen query based on a few example mappings shown in-context, the input to an LLM. Crucially, in-context learning (ICL) does not involve gradient updates. As such, ICL could be a possible \u201cvector of attack\u201d by which a malicious user teaches an LLM in-context to produce harmful outputs, undoing some of the effects of safety fine-tuning.\nGiven the potential negative impact of ICL, this paper develops a framework for studying the effects of in-context learning on \u201cunlearning\u201d the trained behaviour of a model. More specifically, models in the context of safety are trained to refuse to answer certain queries and tasks, which we call a forbidden task. We investigate in a more systematic manner to what extent ICL is able to circumvent the fine-tuning to refuse. A recent work (Wei et al., 2023b) also studied the effects of ICL on undoing safety fine-tuning. They focused on attacking a single model to decrease its harmlessness, and studied using ICL examples at inference time as a defense against gradient-based attacks. In contrast, in this paper, we study the question of in-context learning attacks beyond just harmful content generation and test these ideas on multiple LLMs. Our conclusions regarding safety are more nuanced than the ones of (Wei et al., 2023b) as we show that the ICL attack does not work universally. We propose a specific kind of ICL attack we call the In-Chat ICL attack, which requires the knowledge of the {User} and {Assistant} chat template tokens to craft the ICL attack. In our work, we first look at sentiment classification as a forbidden task and fine-tune a model to refuse to answer sentiment classification queries. This methodology mimics the procedure of producing a specialised language model, e.g. a chatbot of a company, that needs to refuse certain tasks. We then attack the model by teaching it to classify sentiment with in-context examples. For a second forbidden task, we train the model to refuse to summarise news articles based on a weblink, which it cannot do as our models do not have access to the internet. Finally, we experiment with VICUNA-7B, STARLING-7B, and LLAMA2-7B to evaluate whether ICL can break the safety alignment of LLMs. We show that on VICUNA-7B and STARLING-7B ICL does increase the attack success rate. Although we find that on LLAMA2-7B the ICL attack fails, the log-probability of an informative response increases. Further, we show that In-Chat ICL is much better at breaking the safety alignment of LLMs. To summarise, our contributions are:\n We demonstrate on two tasks that LLAMA2-70B can re-learn tasks via in-context learning that it was finetuned to refuse and show a correlation in the attack success rate between different tasks depending on the ICL example token length.\n We demonstrate on two tasks that LLAMA2-70B can re-learn tasks via in-context learning that it was finetuned to refuse and show a correlation in the attack success rate between different tasks depending on the ICL example token length.\n\u2022 We introduce In-chat ICL attacks and show that the safety behavior of VICUNA-7B and STARLING-7B is vulnerable to ICL and In-chat ICL attacks, while LLAMA2-7B is resilient.\n\u2022 We introduce In-chat ICL attacks and show that the safety behavior of VICUNA-7B and STARLING-7B is vulnerable to ICL and In-chat ICL attacks, while LLAMA2-7B is resilient.\n# 2. Background\n2.1. In-context learning\n# 2.1. In-context learning\nPrompting refers to giving the model a list of tokens from which it then autoregressively continues to generate new tokens. In-context learning, also known as few-shot prompting, occurs when we give several input-output pairs in a prompt before we ask for a different example of interest (Brown et al., 2020). If we have examples xi with answers yi then an in-context learning prompt will look like\n[x0]; [y0]; . . . ; [xi]; [yi]; [xj];\nwhere ; is concatenation and xj is the example for which we actually desire the answer yj. This does not involve any gradient updates, and instead happens at inference time.\n# 2.2. Hallucination\nLLMs are prone to what we call hallucinations or confabulations (Guerreiro et al., 2023; Millidge, 2023; Bottou & Sch\u00a8olkopf, 2023). This occurs when the language model produces statements as facts that are obviously false. Obviously false meaning that we can, with relative ease, factcheck a statement to be incorrect. For instance, a made-up reference can easily be verified to not exist. Another example might be \u201cThe earth is flat\u201d or \u201cThe official language of the US is French\u201d.\n# 2.3. Safety & Alignment in Large Language Models\nThe goal of aligning large language models is to achieve the trifecta of helpful, honest, and harmless (Askell et al., 2021). Helpfulness refers to the desiderata that the model make its best attempt at fulfilling the user\u2019s request in an efficient manner. This includes proposing alternative approaches if the user\u2019s request is impractical. Honest means that, at the very least, the model should give accurate information including providing the corresponding level of certainty it has about a given fact. Moreover, the model should be honest about what it knows and its aim is and not try to deceive the user in any way. Harmlessness is the goal that the model should not produce toxic or discriminatory content. It also should refuse to aid in harmful task,\ne.g. when a user asks how to build a bomb it should refuse. Finally, the model should be careful when it provides consequential advice. In this paper, when we talk about \u2018breaking\u2019 the safety alignment of a model we primarily mean either creating harmful examples, or creating dishonest answers by producing hallucinations.\n# 3. Experimental Results\nThe goal of this paper is to evaluate whether in-context learning can undo the fine-tuning intended to teach a model to refuse to answer certain queries.\nGiven a language model f that has the ability to do in-context learning sufficiently well and solve a task T characterised by a set of prompts {xj}, we fine-tune the model f to refuse to answer T . We call the fine-tuned language model f \u2032. We now wish to test in-context learning\u2019s ability to recover task performance that has been destroyed during fine-tuning by training to refuse to answer. Specifically, we want to find a prompt p such that f \u2032([p; x]) \u2248f(x). Where p takes the form of an in-context learning prompt, i.e. p = [x0]; [y0]; . . . ; [xi]; [yi].\nThroughout all experiments unless otherwise mentioned we use the LLAMA2-70B model (Touvron et al., 2023). All fine-tuning is done with either supervised fine-tuning or DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). We also include the default system prompt of LLAMA2 to properly mimic the behaviour of a black box model. For all experiments we use PyTorch together with the Huggingface transformers library for the models, peft library for the QLoRa (Dettmers et al.) weights, and trl library for the implementation of supervised fine-tuning and DPO. We run our code on one to two NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\n# 3.1. Task 1: Sentiment Classification\nThe first task we look at is sentiment classification. Given a phrase or excerpt of a sentence we ask the model to classify whether this example is either negative or positive in tone. In the fine-tuning stage, we train the model to refuse to answer this sentiment classification task, which it normally would perform to the best of it\u2019s ability. The sentiment classification task serves as a proxy to show that preventing the model from performing a given task is non-trivial. Further the task illustrates that for a model to be safe, during the fine-tuning phase, it must learn to distinguish the forbidden task from all other tasks. The benefit of using sentiment classification is that since its output is binary, evaluating an LLM\u2019s refusal compared to \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d is straightforward. In\ncontrast, for more complex queries, LLM\u2019s outputs can be unconstrained, making it challenging to evaluate whether fine-tuning or an attack was successful. More specifically, we fine-tune the model on the SST-2 dataset with direct preference optimisation (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) where we use \u03b2 = 0.25. \u03b2 is a penalty term for the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model f and the fine-tuned weights of f \u2032. We choose the value to be as small as possible1 to ensure that the model learns to refuse well, while preventing it from learning to refuse to answer any question. We verify this manually by asking it other unrelated questions such as \u201cWhat is 5+5?\u201d or \u201cWho is the 45th president of the US?\u201d. We train for 100 steps with batch size 16 and we reach convergence of the log probability of the rejected and chosen responses. See \u00a7A.2.1 for the template. We evaluate the response by counting the occurrence of the words \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019. If only one word occurs we consider that the model classified the sentiment of the sentence. If both or neither occur then we consider that the model refused to classify the sentiment. Note that in the Figure 5 in the Appendix we additionally distinguish between correct and incorrect classification when they occur. In total, we evaluate on 100 held-out examples. The ICL attack uses 16 randomly chosen examples unseen during training. As we can see in Table 1, the model clearly learned to refuse sentiment classification. Instead of always performing the task it rejects to classify in over 90% of cases. However, in-context learning is able to recover the model\u2019s answer to a significant extent. In the Appendix we verify the correctness of the predictions as well (see \u00a7A.1).\n# 3.2. Task 2: Link Hallucination\nThe high-level idea of this task is the following: LLMs that do not have access to the internet cannot summarise a news article only provided as a link. Thus, if they do provide a summary, it must be a hallucination and instead they should be refusing the task. In other words, this is a non-toxic task that the language model should always refuse. If after fine-tuning the model does posses this guardrail, we can incontext teach the model to complete the task anyway, it will be another piece of evidence that in-context learning is able to re-learn a forbidden task. A benefit of this task is that they do not require us to produce misaligned, toxic models. An additional benefit is that it is easy to generate high-quality data given the prevalence of news article datasets.\nTo generate the task, we take the cnn-dailymail dataset to synthetically generate weblinks. We use the first five 1smaller value means that the model can move further away from the original reference model\n1smaller value means that the model can move further away from the original reference model\nTable 1. Attack success rate for sentiment classification and link hallucination (higher means more hallucination). FT-R means finetuning to refuse.

We arbitrarily assign each article to be from one of five websites that are common news producers. We then ask the model, which does not have access to the internet, to summarise this article based on the made up weblink. We train LLAMA2-70B to refuse to summarise news article links with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This provides us with more evidence that the exact method for fine-tuning is not the problem, but instead the inherent abilities of the model. We trained with 50 steps of SFT (batch size 16 and learning rate 0.0002). By looking at the refusal rate in Table 1 we see that this is sufficient for refusal. For the evaluation, we check against keywords (see \u00a7A.3 for the full list). If they are present we conclude that the model refused to summarise the article, else we count it as a hallucination. This should be sufficient since any attempt to summarise the article will always be made up, hence there is no further need to check for the accuracy of the response. We attack the model with 5 in-context examples, less than in the first experiment as the examples tended to be longer. Note we also verified some of the examples manually to ensure the evaluation protocol is working as expected and indeed it is (see \u00a7A.3). Again, we can clearly see that the model successfully learned to refuse to summarise articles based on weblinks in Table 1. However, we strongly recover its ability to hallucinate newspaper synopses with the in-context demonstrations. Interestingly, upon manual inspection we discover that commonly the model does not refuse because of the fact that it is a weblink but instead because a keyword in the title was deemed too sensitive to give an answer about.\nwords of the highlights of each article to generate a title for the weblink. We arbitrarily assign each article to be from one of five websites that are common news producers. We then ask the model, which does not have access to the internet, to summarise this article based on the made up weblink.\n# 3.3. Number of in-context learning examples\nIn this section, we investigate the effect of the number of ICL examples. The goal is to determine whether more examples is necessarily better as well as to see any patterns across the two different tasks.\nIn Figure 1, we plot the number of tokens of the in-context examples against the attack success rate. Because the number of tokens per example varies dramatically between sentiment classification and link hallucination, we choose to plot\nthe number of tokens instead of the number of examples. From the figure we can clearly see that link hallucination and sentiment classification exhibit a similar performance curve. Both peak around 350-500 tokens and after that point decrease. While they increase at different rates this could be due to different fine-tuning methods as well as the fact that the in-context examples of link hallucination are much longer such that only very few examples have been seen at the start of the curve.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/e78a/e78ada86-8eb1-4162-98ea-42eafad86fc7.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1.

Moreover, the link hallucination task captured the honesty facet of safety. Helpfulness is the least likely attack target of the three safety dimensions and also the most dependent on the underlying capabilities of the model thus hardest to separate from the innate abilities of the model versus a successful attack. We now look at breaking the harmlessness aspect of safety in this section.\n# 4.1. Dataset\nAdvBench (Chen et al., 2022) is a dataset consisting of two parts. The first part consists of pairs of a harmful prompt (typically seeking information about a harmful goal) and an affirmative response to the prompt. We give a few examples in Figure 2. The second part of the dataset consists of harmful strings, which are offensive, toxic, or discriminatory. The dataset has 520 harmful prompt-response pairs and 574 harmful strings. For the in-context examples we use the examples from Wei et al. (2023b) that include a full response that goes beyond just the affirmative response (see \u00a7A.4 Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence, suicide, and misinformation.).\n# 4.2. Models\nWe look at several models for the safety analysis: VICUNA7B (Zheng et al., 2023), STARLING-7B (Zhu* et al., 2023), and LLAMA2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023). VICUNA-7B is based on LLAMA2-7B but has been finetuned on userchats with ChatGPT 4. STARLING-7B is based on OpenChat (Wang et al., 2023) and has been trained to be harmless. We use LLAMA2-7B to avoid quantisation as well as having a consistent model size compared to the other models.\n# 4.3. Attack prompt\nWe test two different attack prompts. The first is the classic ICL attack we have studied so far, which consists of a user giving several input-output examples. This looks like {User}:x0; y0; . . . ; xi; yi; x. The second, which we call In-Chat ICL attack, consists of giving the demonstrations as a previous chat between the language model and the user, i.e. {User}:x0; {Assistant}:y0; . . . :\n{User}:xi; {Assistant}:yi; {User}:x. The second approach is similar to a prompt injection attack, but using ICL examples.\n# 4.4. Results\nWe first evaluate the number of responses where, after the ICL attack, the model produces a plausibly affirmative response to a harmful query. To calculate this metric, we follow the methodology used for our other tasks and check for a refusal of the model with a list of keywords (see \u00a7A.4). We present the results in Table 2. We find that the attack somewhat succeeds on VICUNA-7B, succeeds more noticeably on STARLING-7B, but fails with LLAMA2-7B. We further note that more examples seems to help when attacking VICUNA-7B, but makes little tangible difference to STARLING-7B though this can be explained by the high attack success rate. The main difference between VICUNA7B and LLAMA2-7B is that the former has received further fine-tuning on user chats with ChatGPT (Zheng et al., 2023). This implies that extensive safety fine-tuning that LLAMA27B has received has been forgotten by VICUNA-7B to some extent. This demonstrates a need for safety fine-tuning when specialising a model. STARLING-7B on the other hand is based on OPENCHAT (Wang et al., 2023), which in turn is based on MISTRAL-7B (Jiang et al., 2023). OPENCHAT has no safety training and instead the harmlessness is added by the fine-tuning done for STARLING-7B. However, as Table 2 shows this is quite weak and largely circumvented with some in-context examples. For the In-Chat ICL attacks we observe a large improvement in attack success rate for VICUNA-7B and a smaller improvement for STARLING-7B. For LLAMA2-7B, on the other hand, we see no change at all. For VICUNA-7B the attack success rate increases significantly with more examples. We further look at the log probability of generating tokens which correspond to an affirmative response (see \u00a7A.4.2 for which tokens we look at and for the log probability of\nWe further look at the log probability of generating tokens which correspond to an affirmative response (see \u00a7A.4.2 for which tokens we look at and for the log probability of a negative response). STARLING-7B does not tend to give an affirmative response, but instead immediately answers the query making it hard to know which token probabilities to look at. By looking at the change in log probability of an affirmative response, we get an indication whether the\nattack had an effect even if the generated response does not change. We show the difference in log probability between no in-context examples and a varying number of in-context examples in Figure 4. For all three models the change in log probability is positive. For VICUNA-7B and LLAMA2-7B this distribution is nearly entirely above 0. For STARLING-7B the change is not always positive, but this can be explained by the high attack success rate with no examples. In other words for many queries the log probability of STARLING-7B does not change because the attack already succeeds without any examples. For LLAMA2-7B we see that while there is a small improvement in probability it is smaller than for VICUNA-7B. Thus, it may be possible that with better examples and more of them at some point LLAMA2-7B would also be broken by this attack. Only for VICUNA-7B do we see a notable improvement in log probability for the In-Chat ICL attack.\n# 4.5. Limitations\nThe log probability analysis has the key limitation that is only looks at a single token\u2019s probability. It could well be, as is the case for STARLING-7B, that a different token than the one we look at will be indicative of an affirmative or negative response.\n# 4.6. Semantic Analysis\nWhen using the AdvBench dataset one has to be careful as several topics repeat. Thus, we perform a semantic analysis for the results of VICUNA-7B without in-chat examples. In Figure 3 we look at the semantic similarity between queries and the in-context examples for which we have a clear affirmative response or rejection. Given that the 5 demonstrations are semantically distinct examples, we look at the in-context demonstration that is semantically closest to the query. To do this we look at the cosine similarity between the embeddings produced by SENTENCEBERT (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). Subfigure 3b shows the semantic similarity between the query and the most similar in-context demonstration. The result suggests that there is no strong correlation between attack success and the presence of a similar demonstration. In Subfigure 3a we look at the queries with cosine similarity above 0.6 from Subfigure 3b. We find that examples 1 and 2 correlate strongly with the request being rejected, suggesting that their topics seem harder to break (see \u00a7A.4 for the examples).\n# 5. Discussion\nThe goal of this paper was to evaluate whether in-context learning threatens safety alignment by offering end-users a way to get responses to forbidden tasks. The findings on the sentiment classification and link hallucination tasks clearly suggest that after in-context learning, a model might forget\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/c85d/c85d169a-f00e-4abf-90c8-8ec8282ce1d5.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(a) Most similar in-context example, filtering for samples with cosine similarities > 0.6</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/2f62/2f62b626-357f-4968-9c41-0e37ddd2829c.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(b) Cosine similarity between query and most similar in-context demonstration.</div>\nFigure 3.

We observe a clear trend whereby more in-context examples help the performance of the task up to a ceiling of about 50% and then decreases when we too many in-context examples. This is independent of the fine-tuning method chosen, since the result holds for both SFT and DPO. The fine-tuning was as strong as possible before yielding a model that refuses to answer all queries or perform unrelated tasks in-context (see \u00a7A.2 Table 3).\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/5f7a/5f7afb3b-e561-469d-87fb-3be8942ee5d4.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(a) VICUNA-7B</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/5cca/5ccaf1df-96b7-473b-8f66-855ed2c6751a.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(b) LLAMA2-7B</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f9b7/f9b7a922-699a-49ee-bee4-426e73b16fde.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(c) STARLING-7B</div>\nFigure 4. Log probability of affirmative response during ICL vs no examples. Values above 0 mean that the affirmative response of the model to the harmful request became more likely. Below 0 it means the affirmative response became less likely.\nFor the safety task we have a more nuanced picture. The attack is successful against VICUNA-7B and STARLING7B suggesting that indeed the ICL attack trends we saw in the sentiment classification and link hallucination tasks are indeed predictive of what occurs when using ICL attacks to undo safety alignment. However, the attack fails on LLAMA2-7B implying with more extensive fine-tuning, defending against such ICL attacks is possible. Looking more closely at the log probability of an affirmative response we can see that even if the attack fails to generate toxic content on LLAMA2-7B we are still able to make a harmful response more likely. Thus, if the trend observed in Figure 4 continues with better and more examples, an ICL attack may eventually be successful. In addition, given that VICUNA7B is a fine-tuned model based on LLAMA2-7B and is vulnerable to an ICL attack this implies that the fine-tuning likely weakened the safety features of the model. This forgetting is important for practitioners to be aware of. We look at the In-Chat ICL attack to study a more powerful attack format. The In-Chat ICL setting is a form of prompt injection\u2013as it requires the knowledge of the {User} and {Assistant} chat tokens template to craft the ICL attack\u2013 and thus is more restrictive than the classic ICL setting which we first considered. Nonetheless, we argue that attack format is worth studying as an attacker might find ways to control the prompt sufficiently to perform ICL In-Chat. Moreover, the difference in performance for VICUNA-7B In-Chat and STARLING-7B In-Chat suggests that the model is possibly better at learning in context than we thought.\n# 6. Related Work\n# 6.1. Prompting & In-context learning\nSeveral papers have studied prompting mechanisms to teach a LLM a new task. Chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2023a; Yao et al., 2023; Long, 2023), scratchpads (Nye et al., 2021), and in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020; Olsson et al., 2022) being the most common. All of these prompting mechanism have in common to improve the performance of a model on a given task. In this paper we focus on ICL as it is the most promising to teach new general tasks rather than focusing on reasoning tasks.\n# 6.2. Fine-tuning & Safety training\nThe most common fine-tuning method is instruction finetuning or also called supervised fine-tuning (Longpre et al., 2023). It has been shown to improve generalisation (Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Ivison et al., 2023) and alignment (Zhou et al., 2023).\nIn particular for safety concerns reinforcement learning methods have become more popular as a way to fine-tune models. RLHF (Bai et al., 2022) and RLAIF (Lee et al.,\nIn particular for safety concerns reinforcement learning methods have become more popular as a way to fine-tune models. RLHF (Bai et al., 2022) and RLAIF (Lee et al.,\n2023) have been the most popular methods training a reward model and then using PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) to tune the model on the learned reward models. DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) combines the training of a reward model and the reinforcement learning steps into a single optimisation step.\nWhile adversarial attacks have a clear definition in the vision domain (Szegedy et al., 2014; Carlini & Wagner, 2017), the threat model and objective for natural language processing (NLP) have yet to be agreed upon by the community. An objective closely inspired by the vision domain attempts to attack LLMs with the goal that they misclassify certain inputs (Min et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023). Here the threat model is that the attacker may change the string as little as possible to achieve this misclassification. A different objective is to break the model by making it output text that is unaligned, i.e. the string is harmful or dishonest or otherwise unsafe. Adversarial attacks for this objective against LLMs have taken a variety of forms. Broadly they can be categorised into black-box attacks, i.e. no access to the model insides, and white-box attacks, where attackers do have access to the model weights. In the line of work on white-box attacks, Zou et al. (2023) modifies the AUTOPROMPT method (Shin et al., 2020) to use the gradient of the model to automatically find a prompt to generate the affirmative response. Ding et al. (2023) uses automatic prompt rewriting with the most common attacking tricks and scenario nesting, whereby the prompt is hidden within a made up scenario, to attack LLMs in a black-box setting. Very recent work Wei et al. (2023b) also considered ICL examples to attack VICUNA-7B. In comparison to their paper, our analysis is much more extensive and our conclusion more nuanced; we look at two different tasks as well as attacking LLAMA2-7B, showing that ICL attack is not universal. Finally, we investigate the changes in log-probability, which give additional insights into the attack. Their work instead focuses on in-context defense examples in the prompt to defend against in-context attacks. Several works (Yang et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023) have also shown the ease with which one can fine-tune models to be helpful, but harmful with only very little data. Datasets for the task of producing adversarial attacks against LLMs are include AdvBench (Chen et al., 2022) which provides examples of harmful requests that should be denied together with an affirmative response. A second dataset is the red teaming dataset from Ganguli et al. (2022). This dataset consists of transcripts of red teaming attempts. Each red team attempt is scored on how harmful the output from the model is and the target given to the crowd-workers.\nDatasets for the task of producing adversarial attacks against LLMs are include AdvBench (Chen et al., 2022) which provides examples of harmful requests that should be denied together with an affirmative response.

Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have shown that a LLM that has been fine-tuned to a refuse a task can re-learn that task in-context. More specifically, the sentiment classification task and the link hallucination task results show a clear story that across the two most common fine-tuning methods, SFT and DPO, that forbidden tasks can be re-learned. Furthermore, the same in-context learning attack is able to break the safety guardrails of VICUNA-7B and STARLING-7B. This implies that safety checks should consider the in-context learning attack vector. In addition, the qualitative and quantitative similarity across the three settings suggests this training to refuse is an alternative lens to study safety training. The failure of the attack against LLAMA2-7B to generate harmful content suggests defense is possible, however, even against LLAMA2-7B the attack is able to increase the probability of an affirmative response, thus implying that vigilance against and awareness of this vector of attack is necessary. Finally, our semantic analysis suggests that more similar queries are not necessarily better in-context examples. We leave it to future work to investigate if more and better examples can continue increasing the likelihood of an affirmative response on LLAMA2-7B or whether this plateaus before reaching the point of generating a harmful response.\n# 8. Broader Impact Statement\nThis work studies the safety and vulnerability of large language model. This is necessary to create ethical artificial intelligent assistants. Thus our paper has a direct impact and helps practitioners be aware of the risks of their models. While the ideas of this study may also be used to attack models to generate harmful content, we believe that it is necessary to investigate these vectors of attacks so that safer language models can be built and that this outweighs the negatives. This line of work can help raise awareness for legislation, regulation, and deployment of large language models. Our work links safety research to refusing a task, thus potentially making future safety research safer by providing alternatives to toxic benchmarks.\n# 9.

However, the ICL examples are not able to fully recover the lost performance.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/98d4/98d42690-4649-4b68-9f1f-c3622e5aece4.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/a85a/a85a7865-73fa-4062-aee4-ecc2d7159078.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/2fca/2fcab4fa-13e3-443f-9f5f-aaa3c795d4a3.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(b) Label guessed distribution after finetuning ICL attack</div>\n(a) Label guessed distribution after finetuning no ICL\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(a) Label guessed distribution after finetuning no ICL</div>\nFigure 5.

Training with in-context examples\nSo far we have shown that in-context learning can be used to attack LLMs. So the question naturally arises if we train on in-context examples, does this prevent them breaking our alignment? A second follow-up question is at what cost, i.e. does training to refuse in-context examples decrease our ability to in-context learn new different tasks that were not intended. To test this we go back to the sentiment classification task and instead of training on simple sentiment classification we train on the ICL examples we used to break the model and the previous data.\nWe again fine-tune with DPO and use 8 or 4 ICL examples for half of the training data during training. We test on both the original SST-2 dataset as well as the unrelated task in GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) is a high-school math problem benchmark on which the community commonly evaluates both problem solving capabilities and ICL abilities. For the GSM8K we follow the LLAMA2 paper few-shot set-up with 8 examples2. We train with both \u03b2 = 0.2 and \u03b2 = 0.25 to show that allowing the model stray away too far from the reference model leads to a model that refuses to answer any prompt. We show the results in Table 3. At the lower \u03b2 value of 0.2 we can clearly see that the effectiveness of ICL attacks is strongly reduced. Using longer ICL examples during training can help as we can see from difference in recovered performance between training on 8 or 4 ICL examples. Disappointingly, the model has learned to refuse so strongly at this value that the performance on GSM8K has decreased to nearly 0. At the higher \u03b2 value of 0.25 we can see that learning to refuse on in-context examples has not worked. This shows that using ICL training data alone during fine-tuning does not help in defending against this vector of attack.\nWe show the results in Table 3. At the lower \u03b2 value of 0.2 we can clearly see that the effectiveness of ICL attacks is strongly reduced. Using longer ICL examples during training can help as we can see from difference in recovered performance between training on 8 or 4 ICL examples.

The film features a mix of archival footage and body doubles to complete Walker\u2019s scenes. The cast and crew have also spoken about the emotional experience of completing the film without Walker.

Safety task\n# Trigger Warning: this section contains LLM-generated text with violence, suicide, and misinformation. A.4.1. KEYWORDS\nTrigger Warning: this section contains LLM-generated text with violence, suicide, and misinformation. A.4.1. KEYWORDS We use the same keyword list as for the link hallucination task (\u00a7A.3.2). A.4.2. LOG PROBABILITY Here we plot the same data as in Figure 6 but instead we show the mean and standard deviation to better illustrate the average behaviour. To obtain the log probabilities of an affirmative or negative response, we look at the logits of specific tokens at the start of\nthe generated sequence. The specific start-keywords depend on the model, and possibly the goal string. For instance, we look at the logits for the tokens corresponding to Sure for an affirmative response on LLAMA2-7B, and I cannot or I apologize for a negative response on LLAMA2-7B. When there are multiple options, we choose the start-keyword that matches the start tokens of a generated output to a goal prompt with the 5-shot ICL attack; a default string is chosen if the start tokens of the content generated do not exist in our start-keyword list. This works well for models with rigid response formats, but has obvious limitations in models which express a more diverse set of responses. We find that for VICUNA-7B V1.5, all (100%) affirmative responses begin with Sure, and almost all (96%) negative responses begin with I\u2019m sorry. However for Starling-7b-Alpha, although our keyword-based3 method for measuring attack success finds that 248/520 prompts resist the attack, our start-keyword list only captures 15 instances of these generated outputs actually beginning with one of the start keywords. Still, we find that we can deduce some general trends by studying the probabilities of such \u201cnegative\u201d start keywords, while acknowledging the limitations of this method. The complete list of positive and negative start keywords used can be found in Table 4.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/890f/890fa5fb-b12b-4ae0-b73b-6cce2b7303da.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/209a/209a5f1c-c03b-4441-8fa8-84ab3af3171d.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(a) Log probability of affirmative response</div>\nFigure 6.
