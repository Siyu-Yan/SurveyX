Introduction\nThe main objective in this paper is to define a classification/clustering framework that handles both outliers and missing values. Gaussian mixture models [8] (GMM) are the most famous mixture models for continuous data and have been widely used for decades. Indeed, as weighted sums of Gaussian distributions GMMs benefit from attractive Gaussian properties, then dependency between features can easily be modelled through a multivariate Gaussian distribution in order to infer on missing values. However, a major limitation of GMMs is their lack of robustness to outliers that can lead to over-estimate the number of clusters since they use additional components to capture the tails of the distributions [10]. To fill that lack, we proposed to use a scale mixture of Normal distributions [1] in a Bayesian framework. The main advantages of this model is that the model accounts for the uncertainties of variances and covariances since the associated marginal distributions are heavy-tailed [2]. Exact inference in that Bayesian approach is unfortunately intractable and a Variational Bayesian (VB) inference [12] is used to estimate the posterior distribution. The proposed model is explained in Section 2 and inference procedure is derived in Section 3.\nIn this section, the standard GMM is briefly presented as a hierarchical latent variable mode efore introducing missing values and outliers modelling.

At last, the proposed model is developed. 2.1. Latent variable model. A GMM [6] is a natural framework for classification and clustering. It can be formalized as :\n2.1. Latent variable model. A GMM [6] is a natural framework for classification and clustering. It can be formalized as :\np(x|\u0398, K) = \ufffd k\u2208K akN(x|\u00b5k, \u03a3k) ,\n(1)\n\ufffd where x \u2208Rd is an observation, K = {1, . . . , K} is a finite and known set of clusters and \u0398 = (a, (\u00b5k, \u03a3k)k\u2208K), with a = [a1, . . . , aK]\u2032, stands for parameters. Moreover, \u00b5k and \u03a3k are respectively the mean and the covariance matrix of the kth component distribution with a weight ak where ak \u22650 and \ufffd k\u2208K ak = 1.\n \ufffd M.

Email : cyrille-jean.enderli@fr.thalesgroup.com.\nThe GMM can be formalized as a latent model since the component label associated to each data point is unobserved. To this end, a categorical variable z \u2208K can be considered to describe the index of the component distribution generating the observation variable x. Then, the mixture distribution (1) is expressed as\n(2)\nwhere (3)\n(4)\nand \u03b4k z denotes the Kronecker symbol which is 1 if z = k and 0 otherwise. 2.2. Missing values. Missing values can be handled by decomposing the features vector x \u2208 Rd into observed features xobs \u2208Rdobs and missing features modelled by a latent variable xmiss \u2208Rdmiss such that 1 \u2264dobs \u2264d and dmiss = d \u2212dobs.

Outliers. Outliers in a Gaussian mixture model can be handled by introducing a latent variable u to scale each mixture component covariance matrix \u03a3k. That family of mixture models is known as scale mixtures of Normal distributions [1]. Introducing the latent positive variable u into (3), the following scale component distribution is obtained\n(6)\n\ufffd d the joint distribution of (x, u) is derived from (6) such th\n(7)\n\ufffd \ufffd where pk(u) is the prior distribution of u conditionally to z = k. For the sake of keeping conjugacy between prior and posterior distributions of u, a Gamma distribution G(u|\u03b1k, \u03b2k) with shape and rate parameters (\u03b1k, \u03b2k) is chosen for pk(u). Integrating (7) out u, the resulting marginal p(x|z, \u0398, K) is a heavy-tailed distribution known as the Student-t distribution [5].\n2.4. Proposed model. Combining (3), (5) and (6), the following joint latent representation is obtained\n\ufffd \ufffd where h = (xmiss, u, z) are the latent variables. Finally, assuming a dataset X \u2208Rd\u00d7J of i.i.d observations (x1, . . . , xJ) and independent latent data H = (Xmiss, u, z), the complete likelihood function can be expressed as\n\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd the discrete variable introduced to indicate which cluster the data xj belongs to and u = {uj}j\u2208J is the scale variable associated to xj. At last, the Bayesian framework imposes to specify a prior distribution for the parameters \u0398 = (a, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u00b5, \u03a3).

Figure 1 shows the proposed model.\nThe Variational Bayesian inference was introduced in [12] as an ensemble learning method for the mixtures of experts in order to avoid over-fitting and noise level under-estimation problems of traditional maximum likelihood inference. In [3], the Variational Bayesian inference was generalized for different types of mixture distributions and took the name Variational Bayes (VB). VB can be viewed as a Bayesian generalization of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [4] combined with a Mean Field Approach [7]. It consists in approximating the intractable posterior distribution P = p(H, \u0398|X, K) by a tractable one Q = q(H, \u0398) whose parameters are chosen via a variational principle to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nL(Q) is considered as a lower bound for the log evidence log p(X|K) and can be expressed as\n(10)\nThen, minimizing the KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing L(Q). Assuming that q(H, \u0398) can be factorized over the latent variables H and the parameters (\u0398), a free-form maximization with respect to q(H) and q(\u0398) leads to the following update rules :\nVBE-step : q(H) \u221dexp (E\u0398 [log p(X, H|\u0398, K)]) , VBM-step : q(\u0398) \u221dexp (EH [log p(\u0398, X, H|K)]) .\nThe expectations EH[\u00b7] and E\u0398[\u00b7] are respectively taken with respect to the variational posteriors q(H) and q(\u0398). Thereafter, the algorithm iteratively updates the variational posteriors by increasing the bound L(Q). Running the algorithm steps, each posterior distribution is obtained in the following subsections. Noting that p(X, z, u|\u0398, K) can be factorized as p(X|u, z, \u0398, K)p(u|z, \u0398, K)p(z|\u0398, K), a factorized form q(Xmiss|u, z))q(u|z)q(z) is similarly chosen for q(Xmiss, u, z). Moreover, p(\u0398|X, z, u, K can be decomposed as p(a|X, z, u, K)p(\u00b5|\u03a3, X, z, u, K)p(\u03a3|X, z, u, K), the following similar form is chosen for q(\u0398)\n\ufffd Since conjugate priors have been designed in (8) and (9), conjugate posterior distributions are obtained from the VBM-step for \u0398 :\n(11)\n\uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 Calculations of variational posterior distributions related to latent variables H = (Xmiss, H) and parameters \u0398 are presented below. 3.1.
