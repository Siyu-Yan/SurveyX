Introduction\nCloud Computing is more than a technology. It is more than a platform. It is more than just a hosting provider. It is more than just an application hosted as a service. It is more than providing storage services on the Internet. It is a combination of all the above. A 'cloud' is an elastic execution environment of resources involving multiple stakeholders and providing a metered service at multiple granularities for a specified level of quality (of service).  The definition of cloud computing provided by The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as it covers, in our opinion, all the essential aspects of cloud computing:  Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand  network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources( e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  \nVol 2, No 3 (July 2011) \u00a9IJoAT  \nCloud computing employs a service driven business model. Cloud offers services that can  be grouped into the following categories  \uf0b7 Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): Hardware resources (such as storage) and computing power  (CPU and memory) are offered as services to customers. This enables businesses to rent these  resources rather than spending money to buy dedicated servers and networking equipment..  As examples in this category, Amazon1 offers S3 for storage, EC2 for computing power, and  SQS for network communication for small businesses and individual consumers.   \uf0b7 Database as a service (DaaS): A more specialized type of storage is offering database  capability as a service. Examples of service providers are Amazon SimpleDB, Google  BigTable3, Force.com database platform and Microsoft SSDS4. DaaS on the cloud often  adopts a multi-tenant architecture, where the data of many users is kept in the same physical  table.   \uf0b7 Software as a service (SaaS): In this model, software applications are offered as services on  the Internet rather than as software packages to be purchased by individual customers. One of  the pioneering providers in this category is Salesforce.com offering its CRM application as a  service. Other examples include Google web-based office applications (word processors,  spreadsheets, etc.),   \uf0b7 Platform as a service (PaaS): This refers to providing facilities to support the entire  application development lifecycle including design, implementation, debugging, testing,  deployment, operation and support of rich Web applications and services on the Internet.  Most often Internet browsers are used as the development environment. Examples of  platforms in this category are Microsoft Azure Services platform6, Google App Engine7,  Salesforce.com Internet Application Development platform8 and Bungee Connect platform9.  PaaS enables SaaS users to develop add-ons, and also develop standalone Web based  applications, reuse other services and develop collaboratively in a team.   \nplatforms in this category are Microsoft Azure Services platform6, Google App Engine7, Salesforce.com Internet Application Development platform8 and Bungee Connect platform9.

Education is the process of training for developing the mind, character and ability to acquire knowledge, analyze it and take necessary steps in time, especially by formal schooling, teaching and training. Thus, the real purpose of education is spread of knowledge as a service to others. A true teacher should place all learning and all efforts sincerely in the service of humanity without the thought of financial gain for self. Education becomes very powerful tool to wipe out the social issues from the society, if implemented with this principle. The NGO\u2019s who are based on Education can use the Education Cloud, the cloud based framework as defined in next section. \nEducation is the process of training for developing the mind, character and ability to acquire knowledge, analyze it and take necessary steps in time, especially by formal schooling, teaching and training.

Education Cloud\nHowever, cloud computing services could provide many of NGO\u2019s with the opportunity to continue to take advantage of new developments in IT technologies at affordable costs. Cloud computing is likely to be an attractive proposition to start-up and small to medium enterprises and educational establishments. The UK\u2019s National Computing Center (NCC) estimates that SMEs can reduce the total cost of ownership of technology using hosted solutions [14].  Students in the 21st century have different and vast learning needs which no longer can be satisfied with traditional teaching and learning methodologies [15] i.e. lecture-based, tutorial session, use of multimedia contents and etc. It is essential for Universities and schools to adopt new approach and technology that will better prepare and equip students for current and future\nVol 2, No 3 (July 2011) \u00a9IJoAT  \njob market needs. Education Cloud will address the role of cloud computing technology to  improve teaching and learning methodology.   \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/9200/92008442-41a7-4fe0-9407-f82baef64742.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1 Education Cloud </div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1 Education Cloud</div>\n# 3. Advantages of Education Cloud\nThe advantages of the Education Cloud to the NGO\u2019s are studied in the non functional, economic and technological areas.   \nand /or resources. With QoS controls available, cloud providers offer a range of  services and price points that provide more choice to customers and back these  services with service-level agreements (SLAs) that go beyond uptime and mean time  to repair (MTTR) specifications. The result for enterprises is lower-cost IT  infrastructure, applicable to a greater range of application types, obtained by  combining shared platform economics with high levels of performance assurance.  \uf0b7 Availability \u2013 Availability of services and data is an essential capability of cloud  systems. It lies in the ability to introduce redundancy for services and data so failures  can be masked transparently. With increasing concurrent access, availability is  particularly achieved through replication of data /services and distributing them across  different resources to achieve load-balancing  2. Economic Aspects  \uf0b7 Cost Reduction - cloud system can adapt to changing consumer behaviour and reduce  cost for infrastructure maintenance and acquisition. Upfront cost to run the system on  the cloud is very lower.   \uf0b7 Pay per use - The capability to build up cost according to the actual consumption of  resources is a relevant feature of cloud systems. Pay per use strongly relates to quality  of service support, where specific requirements to be met by the system and hence to  be paid for can be specified.  \uf0b7 Improved Time to Market \u2013 NGO can focus on meeting their objectives instead of  spending time on infrastructure which is not their core competency.   \uf0b7 Going Green- Clouds principally allow reducing the consumption of unused resources  (down-scaling).  Users of cloud computing are more likely to significantly reduce the  carbon footprint.  3. Technical Aspects  \uf0b7 Ease of Use - through hiding the complexity of the infrastructure (including  management, configuration etc.)  Cloud can make it easier for the user to develop new  applications, as well as reduces the overhead for controlling the system.  \uf0b7 Location independence: services can be accessed independent of the physical location  of the user and the resource.  \uf0b7 Multi-tenancy - is a highly essential issue in cloud systems, where the location of code  and / or data is principally unknown and the same resource may be assigned to  multiple users (potentially at the same time).  \uf0b7 Data Management - As size of data may change at any time, data management  addresses both horizontal and vertical aspects of scalability. User need not worry  about the database backups.   \uf0b7 Programming Enhancements \u2013 Developers can focus on the business instead of  worrying about issues like scalability.  \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0dbf/0dbfce0b-db9c-4133-b7b6-e090a42fb8f8.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1 Cloud Deployment</div>\n# 4. Kalgidhar Case Study \nThe Kalgidhar Trust is a multifaceted, not for profit charitable organization working for  cause of promoting quality education, primary health, social welfare & spiritual uplift to  underprivileged/deprived rural masses in far-flung rural areas of North India. Its mission is to  establish permanent peace in the world through the synthesis of value based scientific education  and moral rejuvenation thereby creating good global citizens.  Kalgidhar Trust started unique revolution in the rural education with their Akal Academies.  These academies are affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), New Delhi.  These academies have a unique academic center, having comprehensive arrangements for  imparting worldly scientific education in an environment conductive for spiritual evolution.  Currently there are 70 Akal Academies running, spread over northern states of India (Punjab,  North Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh). All of these academies are located in the  backward down-trodden rural areas of North India where education facilities, in general are poor  and use of intoxicants is prevalent. For providing the continuity of value based quality education  from kindergarten to post-graduate level, Eternal University was set up in April 2008 at Baru  Sahib.  Eternal University is running 6 colleges with 1500 students. The future plan of the  Kalgidhar Trust is to open 500 Akal academies across the rural part of the country and add  another 8 colleges to Eternal University in next five years.   Use of Technology - Kalgidhar Trust does require a technology solution which can help in  running their education centers efficiently. Moreover the solution should be scale with their  aggressive growth. Cost of the technology is critical since Kalgidhar Trust works on low cost  self-sustaining organization model with less of paid Management, more of dedicated volunteers  submitting for whole of life and thus low overheads. The total administration expense of The  Kalgidhar Society is only 2.75 % of its annual expenditure.  Educational establishments continue to seek opportunities to rationalize the way they manage  their resources. Cloud computing technologies have changed the way applications are developed  and used. They are aimed at running applications as services over the internet on a scalable \nVol 2, No 3 (July 2011) \u00a9IJoAT  \ninfrastructure. Educations institutions can take advantage of Education Cloud to provide free or  low cost platform which will help them to adapt new teaching learning in meeting the student\u2019s  diverse needs.   \n# 4.1 Uses of Cloud for Kalgidhar Trust \nSeeing the growth of the Kalgidhar trust programs, the scalability provided by Education Cloud is most important benefit to them. By moving from the usual capital upfront investment model to an operational expense, Education Cloud promises to enable Kalgidhar Trust to accelerate the development and adoption of innovative solutions. Kalgidhar Trust can take of advantage of the infrastructure provided by the Education Cloud and focus on building capabilities need to support their objectives. Kalgidhar Trust can use the Education Cloud for the following applications:  1. Integration of all the academies over an Education cloud: - Education Cloud will act as centralized system which connects each academy that make coordination and communication real time. Education cloud will contain all the latest education systems and e learning software. The other academies can use these systems from the centralized system which will reduce the cost of the solution. Moreover, centralized system will have the data of all the academies which will help management in making valuable business decisions in improving the quality of education in all the academies.   2. School management System \u2013 ERP system which integrates student, teacher, accounts, library, facilities and administration.    \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f483/f483c421-5274-4d03-a548-89183d4081f9.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2   Education ERP </div>\n3. University management System \u2013 ERP like system that integrates and manages admissions, courses, students, teachers, accounts, facilities, research, library etc. The system will automate the admission procedure, registration of students, course details, instructor\u2019s details, assignments, grade sheets and transcripts. Students will be able to download their transcripts/grade sheets from online portal.  4. Education Portal- Common place where all the education related resources available from  kindergarten to higher studies. This can be used by students, teachers and parents. This can sub divided into school portal and the university portal.   5. E- learning/ Virtual Classroom - online platform to promote communication, collaboration and understanding among students, teachers, subject matter experts and Corporate around the world. This will help the rural areas to get the quality education. It is seen that rural areas \nhave very less quality teachers compared to urban areas. This will reduce this gap. Moreove the students of the rural areas can learn from the experiences of the experts in the industry. \n# 4.2 Business Opportunity\nThe Kalgidhar Trust is in the education area since 1906. Their strong domain knowledge combine with the Education Cloud can be revenue generator for the Kalgidhar Trust. The education Cloud is formed on the concept of software as service.  The services from Education Cloud can be sold to other schools and universities using a multitenant architecture.  They just need to maintain one more application but can provide lot of value to their customers, i.e. other schools.     \n# 5. Conclusion\nWith help of Education Cloud, the Kalgidhar Trust can focus on the mission of improving lives. Education Cloud can help them in meeting their aggressive future growth of 500 schools. Since all the schools are in the rural areas, this will help in eliminating the social evils from the society. Education Cloud provides cost effective solution in providing the services to support their goal of quality education. Moreover, Education cloud can help them in generating the revenue which can be used on their other philanthropic projects. With the help of the virtual classroom on Education Cloud, the Kalgidhar Trust can start the quality distance education programs which can even reach students of other nations. This will also help to reduce the gap between the university and the corporate world which will eventually help students in meeting their desires of lucrative careers. Other NGO\u2019s can use the Education Cloud to support their objectives in spreading the education thru rural world which will help in solving the social evils of the society.  \n# References \n",
