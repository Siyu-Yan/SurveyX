Let S be an oriented closed surface and T be a triangulation of S with the sets of vertices, edges and triangles V, E, F. Suppose that S is equipped with a constant curvature metric \u00b5. A circle pattern P on (S, \u00b5) is a collection of oriented circles. Say P is T -type if there exists a geodesic triangulation T (\u00b5) of (S, \u00b5) with the following properties: (i) T (\u00b5) is isotopic to T ; (ii) the vertices of T (\u00b5) coincide with the centers of circles in P. In this paper we focus on these circle patterns P = {Cv : v \u2208V} such that Cu,Cw intersect with each other whenever there exists an edge between u and w. Then we have the exterior intersection angle \u0398(e) \u2208[0, \u03c0) for any e \u2208E. One refers to Stephenson\u2019s monograph [26] for more background. Given a function \u0398 : E \u2192[0, \u03c0) defined on the edge set of T , let us consider the following question: Does there exist a T -type circle pattern whose exterior intersection angle function is given by \u0398? If it does, to what extent is the circle pattern unique? A celebrated answer to this question is the following Circle Pattern Theorem due to Thurston [27, Chap. 13].\nTheorem 1.1 (Thurston). Let T be a triangulation of an oriented closed surface S of genus g > 0. Suppose that \u0398 : E \u2192[0, \u03c0/2] is a function satisfying the following conditions: (i) If the edges e1, e2, e3 form a null-homotopic closed curve in S , and if \ufffd3 i=1 \u0398(ei) \u2265\u03c0, then these edges form the boundary of a triangle of T . (ii) If the edges e1, e2, e3, e4 form a null-homotopic closed curve in S and if \ufffd4 i=1 \u0398(ei) = 2\u03c0, then these edges form the boundary of the union of two adjacent triangles.\n \u2192 (i) If the edges e1, e2, e3 form a null-homotopic closed curve in S , and if \ufffd3 i=1 \u0398(ei) \u2265\u03c0, then these edges form the boundary of a triangle of T . (ii) If the edges e1, e2, e3, e4 form a null-homotopic closed curve in S and if \ufffd4 i=1 \u0398(ei) = 2\u03c0, then these edges form the boundary of the union of two adjacent triangles. Then there exists a constant curvature (equal to 0 for g = 1 and equal to \u22121 for g > 1) metric \u00b5 on S such that (S, \u00b5) supports a T -type circle pattern P with the exterior intersection angles given by \u0398. Moreover, the pair (\u00b5, P) is unique up to isometry if g > 1, and up to similarity if g = 1. There are many results relating to Circle Pattern Theorem. See, for example, the works of Andreev [2], Marden-Rodin [19], Colin de Verdi`ere [9], Chow-Luo [7] and others. Meanwhile, a natural problem arises: can we relax the requirement of non-obtuse angles in the above theorem? So far few progress has been made, except for some cases considered by Rivin [21, 22], Bao-Bonahon [3], Bobenko-Springborn [5] and Schlenker [24], respectively. The purpose of this paper is to establish some general results. First let us explain some of our terminologies. A closed (not necessarily simple) curve \u03b3 in S is called a pseudo-Jordan curve, if the complement S \\\u03b3 contains a simply connected component whose boundary is equal to \u03b3. For a pseudo-Jordan curve \u03b3 in S , an enclosing vertex set of \u03b3 consists of all vertices covered by \u2126, where \u2126is any simply connected component of S \\ \u03b3 such that \u2202\u2126= \u03b3. A pseudo-Jordan curve is said to be non-vacant if one of its enclosing vertex sets is non-empty. Theorem 1.2. Let T be a triangulation of an oriented closed surface S of genus g > 1. Suppose that \u0398 : E \u2192[0, \u03c0) is a function satisfying the following conditions: (C1) If the edges e1, e2, e3 form the boundary of a triangle of T , and if \ufffd3 i=1 \u0398(ei) > \u03c0, then \u0398(e1) + \u0398(e2) < \u03c0 + \u0398(e3), \u0398(e2) + \u0398(e3) < \u03c0 + \u0398(e1), \u0398(e3) + \u0398(e1) < \u03c0 + \u0398(e2). (C2) If the edges e1, e2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , es form a non-vacant pseudo-Jordan curve in S , then \ufffds i=1 \u0398(ei) < (s \u22122)\u03c0. Then there exists a hyperbolic metric \u00b5 on S such that (S, \u00b5) supports a T -type circle pattern P with the exterior intersection angles given by \u0398. Remark 1.3. Under the assumption that every exterior intersection angle is non-obtuse, when s > 4, it is easy to see \ufffds i=1 \u0398(ei) \u2264s\u03c0/2 < (s \u22122)\u03c0. Therefore, Thurston\u2019s conditions imply (C2).\n(i) If the edges e1, e2, e3 form a null-homotopic closed curve in S , and if \ufffd3 i=1 \u0398(ei) \u2265\u03c0, then these edges form the boundary of a triangle of T .\n  ii) If the edges e1, e2, e3, e4 form a null-homotopic closed curve in S and if \ufffd4 i=1 \u0398(ei) = 2\u03c0 then these edges form the boundary of the union of two adjacent triangles.\n  Then there exists a constant curvature (equal to 0 for g = 1 and equal to \u22121 for g > 1) metric \u00b5 on S such that (S, \u00b5) supports a T -type circle pattern P with the exterior intersection angles given by \u0398.

A pseudo-Jordan curve is said to be non-vacant if one of its enclosing vertex sets is non-empty.\nRemark 1.4. The contact graph of a circle pattern is a graph which has a vertex for each circle and an edge between two vertices for each intersection component of the corresponding closed disks. For a T -type circle pattern P with acute exterior intersection angles, the contact graph G(P) is isomorphic to the 1-skeleton of T . However in obtuse angle cases the statement may not hold. There is a discussion on relations of G(P) and T in an early arXiv version of this paper. To relieve the burden of involved details, we do not include it here.\n# Theorem 1.5. The pair (\u00b5, P) in Theorem 1.2 is unique up to isometry if ( following condition:\n(R1) If the edges e1, e2, e3 form the boundary of a triangle of T , then I(e1) + I(e2)I(e3) \u2265 I(e2) + I(e3)I(e1) \u22650, I(e3) + I(e1)I(e2) \u22650, where I(ei) = cos \u0398(ei) for i = 1, 2, 3.\nRemark 1.6. The conditions (C1), (R1) are motivated by spherical trigonometry. To be specific, (C1) is satisfied if and only if \ufffd3 i=1 \u0398(ei) \u2264\u03c0 or \u0398(e1), \u0398(e2), \u0398(e3) are the three angles of a spherical triangle, and (R1) is satisfied if and only if \ufffd3 i=1 \u0398(ei) \u2264\u03c0 or each side of the corresponding spherical triangle has length less than or equal to \u03c0/2. In this way one finds that (C1) is strictly wider than (R1). See Proposition 2.7 for details.\nRemark 1.6. The conditions (C1), (R1) are motivated by spherical trigonometry.

As a consequence of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.5, we obtain the following result which is related to the Hyperideal Circle Pattern Theorem due to Schlenker [24]. Theorem 1.7.

On the other hand, if the triangle inequalities hold for all triples of positive numbers ri, rj, rk, then the condition of Lemma 2.4 must be satisfied.

This contradicts to th assumption that \u0398i + \u0398 j + \u0398k > \u03c0. If \u0398k = 0, similar arguments lead to a contradiction. Thus \u0398 j, \u0398k \u2208(0, \u03c0), which implies\nAs a result,\n\u0398i + \u0398 j < \u0398k + \u03c0, \u0398i + \u0398k < \u0398 j + \u03c0.\nSimilarly,\nHence there exists a spherical triangle with angles \u0398i, \u0398 j, \u0398k. Using (9), it is easy to see each side of this spherical triangle has length less than or equal to \u03c0/2. \u25a1\nProof. The proof of (1) is similar to the related results in Ge-Jiang [11] and Ge-Xu [12]. Due to the cosine law of hyperbolic triangles, we have\nIt suffices to show A, B \u21920 as ri \u2192+\u221e.

The formula (2) is derived from a direct computation. Let us consider (3). By the cosine law of hyperbolic triangles, we h\nAs (ri, rj, rk) \u2192(0, 0, c), one obtains\nConsequently,\nIt remains to prove (4). As (ri, r j, rk) \u2192(0, 0, 0), the area of the triangle tends to zero. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet formula, one obtains the desired result. \u25a1\nRemark 2.9. From the above proof, one finds that (1) holds uniformly, no matter how the other two radii behave, even if either or both of them tend to infinity or zero. In addition, regarding \u03d1i as the function of ri, rj, rk, \u0398i, \u0398j, \u0398k, the formula is true as (ri, rj, rk, \u0398i, \u0398 j, \u0398k) varies in R3 + \u00d7 \u039b, where \u039b \u2282[0, \u03c0)3 is any compact set such that the condition of Lemma 2.4 is satisfied.\n# 3 Existence\nTo prove Theorem 1.2, a natural strategy is to follow Thurston [27]. Unfortunately, for three-circle configurations with obtuse exterior intersection angles, the result similar to Lemma 2.2 may not hold (see Remark 4.2). Part of his method does not work. In order to overcome the difficulty, we will employ the topological degree theory. As a comparison, this approach has the advantage of being independent on rigidity.\n# 3.1 Thurston\u2019s construction\nRecall that S is an oriented closed surface of genus g > 1 and T is a triangulation of S with the sets of vertices, edges and triangles V, E, F. Let r \u2208R|V| + be a radius vector, which assigns each vertex v \u2208V a positive number r(v). Then r together with the function \u0398 : E \u2192[0, \u03c0) in Theorem 1.2 determines a hyperbolic cone metric structure on S as follows. For each triangle \u25b3(vivjvk) of T , one associates it with the hyperbolic triangle determined by the centers of three mutually intersecting circles with radii\nr(vi), r(vj), r(vk)\nand exterior intersection angles\n\u0398\ufffd[vi, vj]\ufffd, \u0398\ufffd[vj, vk]\ufffd, \u0398\ufffd[vk, vi]\ufffd.\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Because \u0398 satisfies (C1), Lemma 2.4 implies the above procedure works well. Gluing these hyperbolic triangles produces a metric surface \ufffdS, \u00b5(r)\ufffdwhich is locally hyperbolic with possible cone type singularities at the vertices. For each v \u2208V, the vertex curvature k(v) is defined by k(v) = 2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c3(v),\n\u25a1\nwhere \u03c3(v) denotes the cone angle at v. More precisely, \u03c3(v) is equal to the sum of all inner angles having vertex v. Write k(v) as k(v)(\u0398, r). If there exists a radius vector r\u2217such that k(v)(\u0398, r\u2217) = 0 for all v \u2208V, then it produces a smooth hyperbolic metric on S . For every v \u2208V, on \ufffdS, \u00b5(r\u2217)\ufffd drawing the circle centered at v with radius r\u2217(v), one then obtains the demanded circle pattern.

We shall compute deg(Th(\u0398, \u00b7), \u039b, O) via homotopy method. Namely, deform Th(\u0398, \u00b7) to another map which is relatively easier to manipulate. For each t \u2208[0, 1], note that the function \u0398t = t\u0398 satisfies (C1). Applying Thurston\u2019s construction, Tht(\u00b7) = Th(\u0398t, \u00b7) is well-defined. Moreover, Tht forms a homotopy from Th(\u0398, \u00b7) to Th(0, \u00b7).\nLemma 3.1.

In the second case, let V0 \u2282V be the set of vertices v \u2208V for which rnk(v) \u21920. Then V0 is a non-empty subset of V. We denote by S (V0) the union of these q-cells (q = 0, 1, 2) of T that have at least one vertex in V0, and denote by Lk(V0) the set of pairs (e, v) an edge e and a vertex v with the following properties:\n(i) v \u2208V0; (ii) \u2202e \u2229V0 = \u2205; (iii) e and v form a triangle of T .\nEvidently, S (V0) is an open set of S and thus is a surface.

His work generalizes the results of Guo-Luo [14 and Theorem 1.5.\n\u25a1\n# 5 Finiteness\nTo obtain the proof Theorem 1.8, some knowledge on Teichm\u00a8uller theory is needed. One refers to [1, 17] for basic background. See also [6] from the geometric and topological viewpoint.\n# 5.1 Configuration spaces\nRecall that S is an oriented closed surface of genus g > 1. Denote by T (S ) the Teichm\u00a8uller space of S , which parameterizes the equivalence classes of marked hyperbolic metrics on S . Here a marking is an isotopy class of orientation-preserving homeomorphism from S to itself. And two marked hyperbolic metrics \u00b5, \u00b5\u2032 \u2208T (S ) are equivalent if there exists an isometry \u03c6 : (S, \u00b5) \u2192(S, \u00b5\u2032) isotopic to the identity map. T (S ) admits the structure of a smooth manifold of dimension 6g \u22126. Let pi, pj \u2208S be two points and let \u03b3 be a simple curve with endpoints pi, pj. For any \u00b5 \u2208T (S ), on (S, \u00b5) there exists a unique geodesic in the isotopy class [\u03b3] with the endpoints pi, pj. Let d[\u03b3](\u00b5, pi, pj) denote the length of this geodesic. Under the above manifold structure, d[\u03b3](\u00b5, pi, pj) depends on \u00b5 smoothly. See Buser\u2019s monograph [6, Chap. 6] for details. We endow S with a smooth structure and define a space Z = T (S ) \u00d7 (S \u00d7 R+)|V|. Then Z is a smooth manifold of dimension\nNote that\n# 2|E| = 3|F|.\nTherefore,\n# dim (Z) = 6g \u22126 + 3|V| \u2212\ufffd2|E| \u22123|F|\ufffd = 6g \u22126 + 3\ufffd|V| \u2212|E| + |F|\ufffd+ |E|\ndim (Z) = 6g \u22126 + 3|V| \u2212\ufffd2|E| \u22123|F|\ufffd = 6g \u22126 + 3\ufffd|V| \u2212|E| + |F|\ufffd+ |E| = |E|.\n || A point z = (\u00b5, p1, r1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p|V|, r|V|) \u2208Z is called a configuration, since it gives a choice of a marked hyperbolic metric \u00b5 on S and assigns each vertex vi an oriented circle Ci on (S, \u00b5), where Ci denotes the circle centered at pi with radius ri. To summarise, a configuration z gives a marked hyperbolic metric \u00b5 on S together with a circle pattern P on (S, \u00b5). Briefly, we say z gives a circle pattern pair (\u00b5, P). Let ZT \u2282Z denote the subspace of configurations that give T -type circle pattern pairs. More precisely, z \u2208ZT if and only if there exists a geodesic triangulation T (z) of (S, \u00b5) such that T (z) is isotopic to T and the vertices of T (z) are p1, p2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p|V|. Clearly, ZT is open in Z and thus is a smooth manifolds of dimension |E|.\n# For each e = [vi, vj] \u2208E, the inversive distance I(e, z) is defined by\nwhere [\u03b3e] represents the isotopy class of the edge e. Let ZP \u2282ZT be the subspace of configurations z for which\nBecause I(e, z) is continuous, ZP is open in ZT , which implies ZP is a smooth manifold o dimension |E|. Obviously, a configuration z \u2208ZP gives a T -type circle pattern with the exterior intersection angle \u0398(e, z) \u2208(0, \u03c0) for each e \u2208E, where\nOne establishes the following smooth map\n# e establishes the following smooth map\nEv : ZP \u2212\u2192 Y := (0, \u03c0)|E| z \ufffd\u2212\u2192 \ufffd\u0398(e1, z), \u0398(e2, z), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \ufffd.\n# \ufffd 5.2 Rigidity from the viewpoint of Sard\u2019s Theorem\nNote that a regular point of the above map gives a circle pattern pair which is locally determined up to isometry by its exterior intersection angles. Sard\u2019s Theorem indicates that local rigidity is a generic property.\nProof of Theorem 1.8. Set W0 = Ev(Z0), where Z0 \u2282ZP denotes the set of critical points of Ev. Owing to Sard\u2019s Theorem (Theorem 6.2), W0 has zero measure. Meanwhile, the boundary set \u2202W of W also has zero measure. Thus W \\ (W0 \u222a\u2202W) is a subset of W with full measure. Note that dim (Z) dim (Y)E\nFor each \u0398 \u2208W \\ (W0 \u222a\u2202W) \u2282Y, the Regular Value Theorem (Theorem 6.1) implies that Ev\u22121(\u0398) is a discrete set. Combining with the following Proposition 5.1, this set must be finite. Thus the theorem is proved. \u25a1\nProposition 5.1. Let \u0398 be as above. Then Ev\u22121(\u0398) is compact.\nProof. It suffices to show any sequence {zn} \u2282Ev\u22121(\u0398) contains a convergent subsequence in ZP. Let (\u00b5n, Pn) be the circle pattern pair give by zn. First we claim that there exists a subsequence {znk} converging to a point z\u2217\u2208Z. In view of the topology of Z = T (S ) \u00d7 (S \u00d7 R+)|V|, one needs to check the following two properties:\nY := (0, \u03c0)|E|\n1. No circle in Pn degenerates to a point or becomes infinitely large. 2. The sequence {\u00b5n} is included in a compact subset of T (S ). Because \u0398 satisfies (C1), (C2), similar arguments to the proof of Lemma 3.1 show that the first property holds. For the second property, suppose it is not true. By Fenchel-Nielsen\u2019s coordinates [17, 6], that means there exists at least one simple closed geodesic \u03b3n in (S, \u00b5n) whose length \u2113(\u03b3n) tends to zero or infinity. One claims that the diameter of (S, \u00b5n) tends to infinity. Indeed, if \u2113(\u03b3n) \u2192+\u221e, the statement trivially holds. If \u2113(\u03b3n) \u21920, it follows from the Collar Theorem [6, Chap. 4] that there is an embedding cylinder domain Cy(\u03b3n) in (S, \u00b5n) such that Cy() \ufffdp \u2208(S) | dist(p) \u2264d \ufffd\nwhere dn > 0 satisfies\n  sinh \ufffd\u2113(\u03b3n)/2\ufffdsinh dn = 1.\n \ufffd\ufffd Note that dn \u2192\u221eas \u2113(\u03b3n) \u21920, which also implies the diameter of (S, \u00b5n) tends to infinity. On the other hand, because the radius of every circle in Pn is bounded from above, the diameter of (S, \u00b5n) must be bounded from above. This leads to a contradiction. Next we show z\u2217\u2208ZT . Denote by Tnk the geodesic triangulation for Pnk. One needs to check that no triangle of Tnk becomes infinitely large or degenerates to a point or a line segment. Using Lemma 2.4, this follows from the first property. To finish the proof, it remains to prove z\u2217\u2208ZP. Because {znk} \u2282Ev\u22121(\u0398) \u2282ZP, for any e \u2208E, we have \u0398(e, znk) = \u0398(e). As nk \u2192\u221e, one obtains \u0398(e, z\u2217) = \u0398(e) \u2208(0, \u03c0), which implies z\u2217\u2208ZP. \u25a1\n# 6 Appendix\nIn this section we give a simple introduction to some results on manifolds, especially the topological degree theory. One refers to [13, 16, 20] for more background. Let M, N be two smooth manifolds. A point x \u2208M is called a critical point for a C1 map f : M \u2192N if the tangent map d fx : TxM \u2192T f(x)N is not surjective. Let C f denote the set of critical points of f. And N \\ f(C f ) is defined to be the set of regular values of f. Theorem 6.1 (Regular Value Theorem). Let f : M \u2192N be a Cr (r \u22651) map, and let y \u2208N be a regular value of f. Then f \u22121(y) is a closed Cr submanifold of M. If y \u2208im(f), then the codimension of f \u22121(y) is equal to the dimension of N. Theorem 6.2 (Sard\u2019s Theorem). Let M, N be manifolds of dimensions m, n and f : M \u2192N be a Cr map. If r \u2265max{1, m \u2212n + 1}, then f(C f ) has zero measure in N.\nNow assume that M, N are oriented manifolds of the same dimensions. Let \u039b \u2282M be a relatively compact open subset. Namely, \u039b has compact closure in M. For a point y \u2208N, we use f\u22d4\u039by to denote that y is a regular value of the restriction map f : \u039b \u2192N. Suppose f \u2208C0( \u00af\u039b, N) \u2229C\u221e(\u039b, N), f\u22d4\u039by, and f(\u2202\u039b) \u2208N \\ {y}. If \u039b \u2229f \u22121(y) is empty, the topological degree deg(f, \u039b, y) is defined to be zero. If \u039b\u2229f \u22121(y) is non-empty, the Regular Value Theorem implies that it consists of finite points.\ndeg(f, \u039b, y) = \ufffds i=1 sgn(f, xi).\n\ufffd Here sgn( f, xi) = +1, if the tangent map d fxi : TxiM \u2192TyN preserves the orientation; Otherwise, sgn(f, xi) = \u22121.\nProposition 6.4.

The following lemma is a consequence of Sard\u2019s Theorem. Lemma 6.5.

        "background": "This paper addresses the issue of generalizing Thurston\u2019s Circle Pattern Theorem, which originally studied the existence and rigidity of circle patterns with non-obtuse exterior intersection angles, to the case of obtuse exterior intersection angles. This is significant as circle patterns are valuable tools in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and have applications across various fields of mathematics including combinatorics and computational geometry.",
        "problem": {
            "definition": "The central problem is to determine whether a T-type circle pattern exists for a given triangulation of an oriented closed surface with specified exterior intersection angles, particularly when these angles are obtuse.",
            "key obstacle": "The main challenge is the relaxation of the non-obtuse angle requirement in Thurston\u2019s theorem, which has seen limited progress in prior research."
        },
        "idea": {
            "intuition": "The idea was inspired by the need to explore the properties of circle patterns beyond the constraints of non-obtuse angles, as established by previous works in the field.",
            "opinion": "The proposed idea suggests that circle patterns can still exist and maintain rigidity even when allowing obtuse angles, thus expanding the applicability of Thurston's theorem.",
            "innovation": "The primary improvement lies in the generalization of the Circle Pattern Theorem to encompass obtuse angles, which broadens the scope of circle patterns and their corresponding geometric structures."
        },
        "Theory": {
            "perspective": "The theoretical framework is based on topological degree theory, variational principles, and Teichm\u00fcller theory, which together provide a robust approach to understanding circle patterns in the context of hyperbolic geometry.",
            "opinion": "The assumption is that the existence of circle patterns with obtuse angles can be established through the construction of hyperbolic metrics that support such configurations.",
            "proof": "The paper presents proofs utilizing topological degree theory and variational principles to establish the existence and uniqueness of circle patterns with obtuse angles."
        },
        "experiments": {
            "evaluation setting": "The evaluation involves triangulations of oriented closed surfaces of genus g > 1, with specific functions for the exterior intersection angles defined on the edge set.",
            "evaluation method": "The evaluation steps include constructing hyperbolic metrics and employing topological degree theory to show that the origin is in the image of the relevant mapping, thus proving the existence of the circle patterns."
        },
        "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from the experiments is that circle patterns with obtuse exterior intersection angles do indeed exist, and their properties can be analyzed through the established theoretical framework, thereby extending the applicability of the Circle Pattern Theorem.",
        "discussion": {
            "advantage": "The main advantage of this paper is the successful generalization of the Circle Pattern Theorem, which opens new avenues for research in the field of geometric topology and discrete geometry.",
            "limitation": "A limitation noted is that the conditions under which the results hold may not be fully exhaustive, and certain configurations may still present challenges.",
            "future work": "Future work could focus on identifying more specific conditions under which circle patterns can exist with obtuse angles and exploring their implications in higher-dimensional manifolds."
