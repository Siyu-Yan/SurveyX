A common characteristic of these information sources is that they are exhaustive; that is, they collect information on all health problems detected by health administrations. The main objective of most of these studies is to derive reliable statistical estimates of health outcomes for a set of small areas. This can be achieved using Bayesian hierarchical spatial models that borrow information between neighboring areas (Leroux et al., 2000; Lawson, 2008; Mart\u00ednez-Beneito & Botella-Rocamora, 2019). Unfortunately, health registries only account for a fraction of the information that would be of interest for epidemiological research. For example, risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption or unhealthy behaviors are rarely collected at health databases for the whole population. It may also be of interest to analyze other health indicators such as mental health issues, physical limitation problems, social support needs or health habits with a potential impact on health. These indicators can be obtained from health surveys, which are collected periodically. Unfortunately, in this case, the information is not available for the whole population, but just for a sample of individuals. Survey data are collected following a specific sampling scheme, for instance simple random sampling (SRS) or more complex designs such as stratified or cluster sampling. Whatever the sampling design, all the information used for the data collection mechanism should be included in the analysis, or else inferences will not necessarily be appropriate for the population of interest (Little, 2003; Gelman et al., 2013). Different estimates and modeling strategies have been proposed to account for the sampling design. In a regression context, we can distinguish between area-level and unit-level (individual-level) models, as detailed below. Survey-based small-area estimation has usually been carried out through area-level modelbased approaches, where the original individual-level data are aggregated by area before being modeled. Within this approach, non-spatial estimates are usually derived at a first stage, typically taking into account the sampling design. This is the case of the commonly used Horvitz-Thompson direct estimator, which computes a new area-level outcome of interest weighting sampled individuals according to their associated probability of being sampled (Horvitz & Thompson, 1952). In a second stage, spatial dependence among these designbased estimates is then considered by means of a spatial smoothing model that borrows information between areas (You & Zhou, 2011; Marhuenda et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Mercer et al., 2014; Porter et al., 2014; Paige et al., 2020). These two separate phases produce indirect spatial estimates accounting for the sampling design; nevertheless, the effect of considering two separate estimation phases is not well-known and may introduce biases by simplifying the nature of the problem (Desm\u00e9e et al., 2015; Mauff et al., 2020). Indeed, the direct area-level estimates produced in the first step are used to feed the second stage with-\nout a clear idea of the effect of the simplifying assumptions done in each of these steps. In addition, most of these works consider Normal likelihood models to describe the aggregated data (Fay & Herriot, 1979). However, when small-area sample sizes are small or even zero, the Central Limit Theorem does not hold, so this assumption cannot be reasonably assumed for very small areas (say with less than a few tens of sampled units per area). Moreover, in small-area studies, Normal likelihood models should not be considered if the new area-level response variable is restricted to an interval. For example, if the original individual-level variable is binary, an area-level quantity of interest could be the proportion of successes in each area. For these proportions, which are restricted to the interval [0, 1], normality should not be assumed. Individual-level spatial models have also been proposed to allow estimates of the effect of any covariate associated with the outcome of interest (Mercer et al., 2015; Vandendijck et al., 2016; Watjou et al., 2017; Parker et al., 2020, 2022; Congdon & Lloyd, 2022 Sun et al., 2022; Thompson et al., 2022; Vergara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2023). As previously mentioned, all the information related to the data collection mechanism should be included in the model. This is typically done by modeling the response variable conditional on the design variables, if available, or by including the design weights in the model. Different likelihoods can be assumed depending on the response variable, and estimates or predictions can be made at either the individual level or aggregated up to any desired level of the hierarchy via post-stratification (Little, 1993). This statistical procedure is known in the literature as multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP) (Gelman & Little, 1997; Park et al., 2004, 2006). Recently, a correlated spatial random effect has been included in a model to explain spatial dependence between neighboring areas when the outcome of interest is binary (Vergara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2023). Once the model has been fitted, individual estimates are post-stratified to reproduce these effects on the geographical areas of interest according to their population totals, adjusting for selection bias and correcting for differences between the sample composition and that of the geographical areas of interest. Usually, health survey questions have different response options, so that respondents answer the one that seems most appropriate to them. In addition, these answer options are often ordered or ranked. For instance, a question about smoking frequency may have four response levels: 1 = Never smoked/only tried; 2 = Don\u2019t smoke but have smoked; 3 = Smoke but not daily; and 4 = Smoke daily. Therefore, it is common to find ordinal data in surveybased studies. However, to our knowledge, there is currently no literature on spatial models for ordinal survey-based data. The analysis of ordinal data is a non-standard statistical area. In fact, the most typical likelihood families do not fit to data of this kind. As a consequence\nof this complexity, spatial dependence is usually ignored, although survey respondents have spatial attributes. The spatial analysis of ordinal survey-based data merges several statistical research branches, at least spatial statistics, analysis of ordinal data and analysis of survey data with complex sampling designs, making the development of methods for data of that kind a particularly challenging task. The main objective of this paper is to develop a Bayesian hierarchical individual-level model for small-area analyses from ordinal survey-based data. The model, which simultaneously accounts for spatial dependence and sampling design information at a single stage, allows estimating finite quantities of the population of interest under a known informative sampling design via the MRP approach. Hence, it entails an expansion of applications in spatial smallarea epidemiological studies to the spatial analysis of ordinal survey-based data. By using this methodology, ordinal data from health surveys can be easily summarized and exploited to a greater extent, taking into account the spatial nature of the data. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews individual-level models for small-area survey-based studies within the MRP approach. Our proposed model for ordinal data within this context is subsequently introduced. Section 3 applies this methodology to the Health Survey of the Region of Valencia (Spain) of 2016 (HSRV2016). Finally, Section 4 concludes with some final remarks and future work.\n# 2 Methodology\nIn this section, we first provide background on individual-level models for small-area surveybased studies within the MRP approach. Next, we detail a proposal for ordinal data analysis within this framework.\n# 2.1 Background\nSurvey-based data analyses should include all the information used for the sampling design, otherwise model-based estimates will be subject to potentially large biases (Little, 2003; Gelman et al., 2013). This can be done by modeling the individual-level response variable conditional on the design variables. For instance, if a cluster sampling scheme is followed, a cluster-level random effect may be used in the model to take this into account. If a stratified design is used instead, one should include fixed effects accounting for the strata. The idea is that when all the design variables are taken into account in the model, the conditional distribution of the response variable given the covariates for\n# the sampled units is independent of the inclusion probabilities, and so we can consider the sampling design as ignorable. If the design variables were unknown, the sampling design could be alternatively taken into account by including the design weights in the linear predictor (Vandendijck et al., 2016; Watjou et al., 2017) or by considering a pseudo-likelihood approach (Binder, 1983; Skinner, 1989). From now on, we assume a context where all the design variables are known.\nthe sampled units is independent of the inclusion probabilities, and so we can consider the sampling design as ignorable. If the design variables were unknown, the sampling design could be alternatively taken into account by including the design weights in the linear predictor (Vandendijck et al., 2016; Watjou et al., 2017) or by considering a pseudo-likelihood approach (Binder, 1983; Skinner, 1989). From now on, we assume a context where all the design variables are known. Usually, individual-level models incorporate demographic and/or geographic subgroups as covariates (e.g. sex, age group, ethnicity, education, geographic location, etc.). The reason is that either these categorical covariates are involved in the sampling scheme, such as the strata cells in a stratified sampling design, or simply they have a relevant effect on the response variable. Whatever the reason, the combination of all the categories of these covariates defines the so-called post-stratification cells, that will be later on used to derive population estimates at any level of the hierarchy, via post-stratification, correcting any potential difference between the sample and population compositions. Within the MRP approach, ignorability corresponds to the assumption of SRS within each post-stratification cell; that is, equal inclusion probabilities for the individuals within cells (Gelman, 2007). If this assumption is met, unbiased estimates of the effect of these cells are easily obtained and poststratification takes care of correcting any potential discrepancy between the sample and the population corresponding to each cell, thus producing adequate estimates at the area/group level of interest. Different survey-based studies have used the MRP approach to derive weighted survey estimates (Zhang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Buttice & Highton, 2017; Downes et al., 2018; Gelman et al., 2018; Downes & Carlin, 2020; Gao et al., 2021). These studies, which traditionally use just independent random effects, do not account for spatially structured variability. Within the context of the MRP approach, Vergara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2023) have recently proposed a novel approach to estimate the proportions of a binary variable within the smallarea estimation framework. In that work, the authors present a logistic individual-level model that integrates the sampling scheme followed (e.g. stratified sampling), auxiliary variables and geographical variability. That approach can be summarized as follows: Let Yi \u2208{0, 1} be a binary response variable for the i-th individual of the population of interest (i = 1, . . . , N). Let us assume that the study region is divided in K small areas, being {Nk}K k=1 their known population sizes, so that N = \ufffdK k=1 Nk stands for the total population size of the study region. A sample of size nk is drawn from each area k following a known sampling scheme (e.g. SRS, stratified or cluster sampling), where some of the nk could be zero (e.g. small areas not sampled within a cluster sampling design). Hence, the total sample size is n = \ufffdK k=1 nk < N,\nwhich means that only some values of Yi are observed, the ones corresponding to the n survey respondents. Without loss of generality, we assume that the first n individuals in the population correspond to the survey respondents, while the following are all unobserved; that is, the observed values are yi, i = 1, . . . , n. Let xi = (zi, mi)T denote the vector containing the value of a categorical covariate (zi \u2208{1, . . . , H}) and the small area (mi \u2208{1, . . . , K}), both corresponding to the i-th respondent. Note that zi could be either a stratification variable used for the sampling design or an auxiliary variable used to improve the proportion estimates. If more than one variable of this kind were available, they could be considered accordingly in the subsequent model. The following likelihood is assumed:\n# yi|\u03c0(xi) \u223cBernoulli(\u03c0(xi)),\nwhere \u03c0(xi) = P(Yi = 1|xi) is modeled as:\nlogit(\u03c0(xi)) = \u00b5 + \u03b1zi + \u03b8mi.\nIf zi was the only variable involved in the sampling scheme, given xi, the individuals would be sampled following SRS within each level and, therefore, the sampling design would be ignorable. In this proposal, the intercept is assumed to have an improper uniform prior; that is, p(\u00b5) \u221d1; the effect of the auxiliary (categorical) covariate is modeled such that \u03b11 is set to 0, while improper uniform priors are also considered for \u03b12, . . . , \u03b1H; and a spatial CAR prior (Leroux et al., 2000) is used to induce spatial dependence on \u03b8 = (\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8K)T. Note that we have denoted the probability of success for each individual as \u03c0(xi) in order to be consistent with the individual-level notation. However, these probabilities can only take as many values as combinations of the H levels of the categorical covariate and the K small areas; that is, respondents with the same value of zi and mi (equivalently xi) have the same value of \u03c0(xi) according to Model (1). Therefore, given the vector x = (h, k)T, we can alternatively denote those probabilities as simply \u03c0hk. Once the model has been fitted, the derived \u02c6\u03c0hk estimates can be subsequently post-stratified to compute population estimates at a small-area level. For instance, the real proportion of success for the k-th areal unit can be estimated post-stratifying the cell estimates \u02c6\u03c0hk as (Gelman & Little, 1997; Park et al., 2004, 2006):\nn size of level h and area k. This post-stratification proc\n(1)\nverts the model estimates into population quantities that incorporate the composition of each area in terms of the auxiliary/stratifying variable. In summary, that proposed methodology merges tools accounting for sampling designs, the use of auxiliary variables and spatial methods in a common framework in order to derive sensible small-area estimates taking the data collection process into account.\n# 2.2 Our proposal: A regression model for small-area inferenc with ordinal data\nFollowing the guidelines described previously, which allow us to take into account both the sampling design and spatial dependence of the data, we develop here a methodology for the analysis of spatial ordinal survey-based data. To our knowledge, this has not been previously proposed in the spatial literature. Let Yi \u2208{1, . . ., J} be an ordinal response variable that quantifies a health indicator for the i-th individual of the population of interest, i = 1, . . . , N. Let y = (y1, . . . , yn) denote the vector containing the observed values for all respondents. Let us now assume that N(\u00b7) and n(\u00b7) represent, respectively, the population and sample size according to their subscript. Thus, {Nk}K k=1 and {nk}K k=1 have exactly the same meaning as before. First, we will focus on the case of a single categorical covariate zi with H levels, as for example the stratum in a stratified sampling design. In that case, xi = (zi, mi)T is the covariate vector that indicates the level h (zi = h \u2208{1, . . . , H}) and the small area k (mi = k \u2208{1, . . ., K}) to which the i-th respondent belongs. The following likelihood is assumed:\nFollowing the guidelines described previously, which allow us to take into account both the sampling design and spatial dependence of the data, we develop here a methodology for the analysis of spatial ordinal survey-based data.

In that case, xi = (zi, mi)T is the covariate vector that indicates the level h (zi = h \u2208{1, . . . , H}) and the small area k (mi = k \u2208{1, . . ., K}) to which the i-th respondent belongs. The following likelihood is assumed:\nyi|\u03c0(xi) \u223cCategorical(\u03c0(xi)),\nwhere \u03c0(xi) = (\u03c01(xi), \u03c02(xi), . . ., \u03c0J(xi))T is the vector that contains the probabilities for the different categories associated with the i-th respondent given xi; that is, \u03c0j(xi) = P(Yi = j|xi), j = 1, . . ., J. Since Yi is ordinal, it seems more natural to model its cumulative probabilities instead of the probability of each category (McCullagh, 1980; Congdon, 2005). Namely, let \u03b3j(xi) denote the cumulative probability of categories 1 to j given xi; that is:\n\u03b3j(xi) = P(Yi \u2264j|xi) = \u03c01(xi) + \u03c02(xi) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03c0j(xi), j = 1, . . . , J,\nwhere 0 < \u03b31(xi) < \u03b32(xi) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03b3J\u22121(xi) < \u03b3J(xi) = 1. In that case, we model the first\n(2)\nwhere \u03ba1 < \u03ba2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03baJ\u22121. This proposal falls within the Proportional Odds Logisti Regression (POLR) models (McCullagh, 1980).\nNote that if \u03b1zi and \u03b8mi (covariate effects) were removed from Model (3), all individuals would share the same vector of probabilities, independently of their stratum and small area. In that case, \u03b3j(xi) = logit\u22121(\u03baj) = exp{\u03baj}/(1 + exp{\u03baj}) = F(\u03baj), j = 1, . . ., J \u22121, where F denotes the standard logistic cumulative distribution function. So, the set of parameters \u03ba1 < \u03ba2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03baJ\u22121 could be interpreted as cut points of the standard logistic probability density function, establishing the probability of each category as the area under that density function between the two corresponding consecutive cut points (Congdon, 2005; Faraway, 2016; Dobson & Barnett, 2018). This is illustrated in Figure 1 (a) for an arbitrarily chosen set of values. In addition, positive values of \u03b1zi (equivalently \u03b8mi) increase the values of \u03b3j(xi) for the corresponding level (or the corresponding small area), and so low values of Yi are more likely to occur. In particular, the probability of the first category of Yi increases, while the last one decreases. Negative values of \u03b1zi or \u03b8mi have the opposite effect. This is illustrated in Figure 1 (b) for the case of an arbitrary positive effect \u03b1h. Finally, in the complete Model (3), \u03b3j(xi) = logit\u22121(\u03baj +\u03b1zi +\u03b8mi) = F(\u03baj +\u03b1zi +\u03b8mi), j = 1, . . . , J \u22121. So, the set of parameters (\u03baj +\u03b1zi +\u03b8mi)J\u22121 j=1 are the cut points of the standard logistic probability density function for the stratum and small area corresponding to the i-th respondent.\n# 2.2.1 Prior distributions\nWe assume \u03b11 = 0 and {p(\u03b1h)}H h=2 \u221d1; that is, improper uniform priors for the fixed effects associated with the categorical covariate. Instead of assuming a corner constraint as this, we could alternatively assume a zero-sum constraint; that is, \u03b11 = \u2212 \ufffdH h=2 \u03b1h, depending on the convenience of parameterization of the model. Regarding the spatial random effect, we assume \u03b8 to follow a Leroux CAR prior distribution (Leroux et al., 2000); that is, (\u03b8|\u03c32, \u03bb) \u223cLCAR(\u03c32, \u03bb). For the hyperparameters of the spatial random effect, we assume non-informative uniform prior distributions: \u03c3 \u223cU(0, 10) and \u03bb \u223cU(0, 1). The upper limit in the first of these uniform distributions is intended to assume a vague prior distribution on \u03c3. In addition, we assume a total of H zero-sum constraints for the spatial random effect, one for each level of the categorical covariate. This is done in order to avoid spatial confounding problems between fixed and spatial random effects, that could have some influence on the post-stratification phase of the model, to be\n(3)\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/698a/698a751e-6795-4eb3-9ebe-067f6a7f7e9b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: (a) An illustrated example of the interpretation of {\u03baj}J\u22121 j=1 from Model (3) as cut points of the standard logistic probability density function: f(x) = exp{x}/(1 + exp{x})2 (b) A positive value of \u03b1zi from Model (3) would move all cut points towards the right a distance equal to the value of that effect, changing the relative probabilities of all five categories.</div>\nintroduced below (Reich et al., 2006; Hodges & Reich, 2010; Mar\u00ed-Dell\u2019Olmo et al., 2014; Mart\u00ednez-Beneito & Botella-Rocamora, 2019). Specifically, the constraints are formulated as zero-sum constraints for the spatial effects associated with respondents that fall within the same level h; that is, \ufffd i:zi=h \u03b8mi = 0, h = 1, . . . , H. In fact, those constraints are equivalent to assuming orthogonality restrictions between the vector (\u03b8mi)n i=1 and each column of the design matrix of fixed effects (zih)1\u2264i\u2264n,1\u2264h\u2264H, where zih = 1 if zi = h and 0 otherwise. Note that these orthogonality restrictions can be seen simply as weighted constraints by the number of respondents in each small area within each level h; that is, \ufffdK k=1 nhk\u03b8k = 0, h = 1, . . ., H. The prior distribution for vector \u03ba = (\u03ba1, . . . , \u03baJ\u22121)T is defined according to two premises: (i) all the categories should have equal prior probabilities and (ii) it should fulfill the order constraint \u03ba1 < \u03ba2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03baJ\u22121. This can be achieved by including in the model a new vector \u03b4 = (\u03b41, . . . , \u03b4J)T, where 0 < \u03b4j < 1, j = 1, . . . , J, and \ufffdJ j=1 \u03b4j = 1, so that \u03b4 \u223cDirichlet(1J). Then, if we define the vector \u03ba as a monotonic transformation, into the whole real line, of the cumulative sums of the components of \u03b4, assumptions (i) and (ii) are met. Specifically, \u03baj is defined as:\n(4)\nwhich takes the values of \u03b4, defined in the (0, 1) interval, to the whole real line and satisfies the order constraint of the components of \u03ba. However, direct modeling of the vector \u03b4 with a Dirichlet prior distribution is not possible to implement in WinBUGS, the software used in our case study. Alternatively, let us assume that \u03b4 follows a stick-breaking process (Sethuraman, 1994). The process is based on the idea of breaking a \u201cstick\u201d of unit length into J pieces similar to each other. To do this, a different proportion of stick is taken in each iteration depending on the length of the stick remaining in the previous one. That is, let \u03c9 = (\u03c91, . . . , \u03c9J\u22121)T be the vector containing the successive proportions of stick taken in each iteration. The stick-breaking process can be defined as follows:\n\u03c9j \u223cBeta(1, J \u2212j), j = 1, . . ., J \u22121.\nDefining the lengths of the pieces as:\nwe ensure that the sum of the lengths equals 1; that is, \ufffdJ j=1 \u03b4j = 1. That stick-breaking process is equivalent to assuming a Dirichlet prior distribution on \u03b4 with its vector of parameters equal to a vector of ones (Sethuraman, 1994; Paisley, 2010). Hence, as wanted, the stick-breaking process allows the J categories to have equal prior probabilities. Note that we assume the logit function to transform the vector \u03b4 into \u03ba (see Expression (4)) due to the interpretation of the components of \u03b4. In fact, if the covariate effects were removed from Model (3), each cumulative probability would be equal to the corresponding cumulative sum of the components of \u03b4; that is, the components of \u03b4 could be interpreted as the probabilities for the different categories.\n# 2.2.2 Extending the model\nNote that the fixed effects {\u03b1h}H h=2 in Model (3) have, in the logit scale, the same effect across the different categories of the ordinal response variable, which could be a strong assumption. In order to alleviate this, it is possible to allow the covariate of interest to have different effects for each level of the cumulative probabilities and, consequently, for each level of the response variable. This extension of the model, which falls within Partial Proportional Odds\nlogit(\u03b3j(xi)) = \u03baj + \u03b1zi,j + \u03b8mi, j = 1, . . ., J \u22121,\nbut it does not guarantee the order constraint of the cumulative probabilities \u03b3j(xi). Alternatively, Model (5) is equivalent to assuming that the intercepts \u03baj interact with the covariate of interest. Therefore, they vary for each j and each value of the categorical covariate:\nlogit(\u03b3j(xi)) = \u03bazi,j + \u03b8mi, j = 1, . . . , J \u22121.\nModel (6) ensures the order constraint 0 < \u03b31(xi) < \u03b32(xi) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03b3J\u22121(xi) < 1, for every value of zi, by means of a collection of stick-breaking processes as prior distributions for the rows of the matrix \u03ba = (\u03bahj)1\u2264h\u2264H,1\u2264j\u2264J\u22121.\nIt should be noted that Model (6) becomes more complex if one introduces more than one categorical covariate interacting with \u03baj to explain the ordinal response variable. In fact, in complex sampling designs, it is common to have different combinations of strata based on demographic-geographic characteristics, such as sex, age group, ethnicity, education, geographic location, etc. In that situation, the term \u03bazi,j in Model (6) should be changed by \u03bazi,wi,...,j where the subindex depends on all the covariates interacting with \u03baj.\n# 2.2.3 Post-stratification\nOnce the model has been fitted, we obtain as a result the estimates of the probabilities of the different categories for all respondents; that is, \u02c6\u03c0j(xi), j = 1, . . . , J, i = 1, . . . , n. These estimates correspond to each combination of the H levels of the categorical covariate and K small areas. If small-area estimates are pursued, these individual estimates should be post-stratified in order to reproduce the strata composition and particular effect of each geographical location. Usually, there is an interest in estimating finite population quantities, such as the proportion of individuals in each category of the response variable in area k:\nPjk = 1 Nk \ufffd i:mi=k [Yi = j] = 1 Nk H \ufffd h=1 \ufffd i:mi=k zi=h [Yi = j], j = 1, . . . , J,\n(5)\n(6)\nwhere [Yi = j] takes the value 1 if Yi = j and 0 otherwise. The proportions Pjk, j = 1, . . ., J for a particular small area k could be estimated as:\n# where [Yi = j] takes the value 1 if Yi = j and 0 otherwise. The proportions Pjk, j = 1, . . ., J for a particular small area k could be estimated as:\n\u02c6Pjk = 1 Nk H \ufffd h=1 \ufffd \ufffd i\u2208shk [yi = j] + \ufffd i\u2208s\u2032 hk \u25ca\ufffd [Yi = j] \ufffd , j = 1, . . . , J,\nwhere shk and s\u2032 hk denote the sets of sampled and non-sampled individuals from level h and area k, respectively. For simplicity, we assume throughout this paper that nhk/Nk is small for all h and k, which is a common scenario in survey studies. So, finite population quantities of interest are essentially the same as the corresponding superpopulation quantities (Gelman, 2007; Vergara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2023). Therefore, we can ignore in practice all finite population corrections and the real proportions Pjk, j = 1, . . . , J could be simply estimated following the MRP approach as (Gelman & Little, 1997; Park et al., 2004, 2006):\nwhere \u02c6\u03c0jhk is the estimated probability of category j in level h and area k. Indeed, Expression (7) yields weighted survey estimates that correct for potential differences between the composition of the samples and those of the respective populations. Note that this estimate requires knowing the population size of each level h and area k, Nhk, which will be known in general if the categorical covariate is a stratifying factor of the sampling design or an auxiliary variable (Vergara-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2023).\n# 3 A case study\nIn this section, we apply the methodology developed in Section 2.2 to the study of selfperceived health, one of the variables included in the HSRV2016. This variable, which can be interpreted as an assessment of self-perceived health status, which is a good general summary of health status, was recorded for the population over 14 years old. The variable has J = 5 response levels: 1 = Very good; 2 = Good; 3 = Regular; 4 = Bad; and 5 = Very bad, ordered from better to worse self-perceived health. The sampling design of the HSRV2016 is described below in order to incorporate it into the statistical analysis. A total of 5485 surveys were conducted following a two-stage sampling scheme. The first sampling stage corresponds to a stratified sampling design, where the sample units are the dwellings and the strata are formed according to the age composition of the members of each dwelling. Specifically, there are 4 strata defined as: 1 = Dwellings with\n(7)\n minor (without residents over 74); 2 = Dwellings with 2 or more minors (without residents ver 74); 3 = Dwellings with residents over 74; and 4 = Other dwellings. For each of the 24 ealth departments in the Region of Valencia (RV) a stratified sample with the mentioned trata was drawn and simple random sampling within each stratum. In the second stage, the ample units are the residents of the dwellings selected in the previous stage. In particular, urveys are collected from all residents over 64 years old, and 50% of residents between 15 nd 64 by SRS. To obtain small-area estimates, with considerable geographical disaggregation, we consider ere the municipality as the spatial unit of interest, with a total of 542 municipalities in the RV. Let xi = (si, ai, di, mi)T be the vector containing the values of the categorical covariates nd small area (municipality) for the i-th respondent, where: \u2022 si \u2208{1, 2} denotes the sex: 1 = Male and 2 = Female. \u2022 ai \u2208{1, . . . , 5} denotes the age group: 1 = [15, 45); 2 = [45, 65); 3 = [65, 75); 4 = [75, 85); and 5 = [85, . . .). \u2022 di \u2208{1, . . . , 4} denotes the dwelling stratum of the sampling design with the same meaning as introduced above. \u2022 mi \u2208{1, . . . , 542} denotes the municipality. From now on, we will refer to the small area as m instead of k. Let us consider Model (6), which in this case study can be formulated as: logit(\u03b3j(xi)) = \u03basi,ai,j + \u03b1di + \u03b8mi, j = 1, . . ., J \u22121. (8)\nlogit(\u03b3j(xi)) = \u03basi,ai,j + \u03b1di + \u03b8mi, j = 1, . . ., J \u22121.\nIn this case, we assume the sex and age-group covariates (and their interaction) to have different effects on the cumulative probabilities; that is, individuals with different values of these covariates would have different, completely independent, cut Prior distributions for \u03ba and \u03b8 are those described in Section 2.2.1. In this case study, we assume contiguity between municipalities as the criterion for defining the adjacency matrix for \u03b8. For the dwelling fixed effects, we assume improper uniform priors {p(\u03b1d)}4 d=2 \u221d1, with \u03b11 = \u2212 \ufffd4 d=2 \u03b1d. In this manner, \u03ba and \u03b8 may be interpreted as the corresponding effects for an average dwelling stratum. The model was implemented in the MCMC programming language WinBUGS (Lunn et al., 2000). The WinBUGS code and the R code used to run the entire study can be found at points. The need for these different cut points will become evident below. (https://github.com/bsmiguelangel/bayesian-modeling-of-spatial-ordinal-data-from-health-su We ran five chains in parallel with 6000 iterations per chain. Of these, the first 1000 itera-\n(8)\ntions were discarded as burn-in, and the resulting chains were thinned to retain one out of every 25 iterations. Therefore, a total of 1000 simulations from the posterior distribution were saved for each parameter of interest. Convergence was assessed by means of the Gelman-Rubin statistic and the effective sample size. Convergence was checked for all the model parameters. Specifically, the Gelman-Rubin statistic was not greater than 1.10 and the effective number of simulations was not lower than 100 for any of the parameters. Figure 2 shows the standard logistic probability density function and the posterior distribution of the cut points for each combination of sex and age group levels, defining the probabilities of each category as the area under the density function between two corresponding consecutive cut points. According to this figure, we can see that as age increases, the cut points move to the left; that is, a higher probability of categories with worse self-perceived health is estimated for the oldest groups. Moreover, interaction between sex and age-group covariates is clearly necessary since, for example, sex has no effect for the youngest groups but it has a clear effect for the oldest ones. Specifically, young males and females seem to perceive similar levels of health, while in the case of the oldest groups, females clearly have lower cut points than males, pointing out worse self-perceived health. In addition, interaction between those covariates and the levels of the cumulative probabilities is also necessary, since the cut points for males and females, within the same age group (e.g. [75, 85)), do not usually differ by an average fixed value. Interestingly, note that 95% credible intervals of the last cut point for both males and females within the age group [15, 45) are the widest. This is possibly due to the fact that there are only a few respondents within that age group who report \u201cVery bad\u201d self-perceived health. Figure 3 (a) shows the geographic pattern of the spatial random effect, specifically the posterior means of the elements of vector \u03b8. Each color refers to one of the nine equal-probability intervals that have been used to discretize those posterior means. This allows us to visualize which municipalities show particularly worse or better self-perceived health. Indeed, the green (brown) color represents the municipalities with better (worse) self-perceived health. Note that \u03b8 accounts for the geographic variability that is not explained by the covariates or, in other words, it shows the remaining spatial pattern after controlling for the effect of sex and age group on the available sample. Figure 3 (b) shows the relevance of the components of the spatial random effect. Specifically, we measure this relevance as P(\u03b8m < 0|y) (posterior probability of worse self-perceived health than the entire region as a whole), m = 1, . . . , 542. Values of that probability close to one (zero) imply a high (low) probability that the associated spatial random effect is negative. Recall that negative values of the components of \u03b8 make the cut points smaller (lower cumulative probabilities), increasing so the probability of\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/77a5/77a5b3ab-7f85-4ac2-9e5e-ba8ebbe8786e.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: Posterior distribution of all the cut points {\u03basaj}1\u2264s\u22642,1\u2264a\u22645,1\u2264j\u22644 associated with the five age group levels and sexes.

Within each subfigure, both the posterior means and 95% credible intervals of the cut points for each sex are shown. the last category (\u201cVery bad\u201d). We consider in Figure 3 (b) the spatial effect to be relevant if that probability is greater than 0.8 or less than 0.2. In summary, for those municipalities coloured in red we have evidence of worse self-perceived health and for those in green we find evidence of a better health. It is important to emphasize here that the fixed effects of the dwelling strata had no relevant association with the response variable (see Supplementary Information); that is, it has no effect on self-perceived health. Therefore, from now on, we assume its contribution linear predictor term equal to zero. This assumption is equivalent to consider no variability between dwelling strata, as suggested by the model results. Figure 4 shows six maps. The first five maps show the geographic pattern of populationlevel percentages for each of the categories of the response variable; that is, \u02c6Pjm \u00d7 100, j = 1, . . ., 5, m = 1, . . . , 542 (see Expression (7)). In a first stage, once the model has been fitted, estimates of the probabilities for each sex s, age group a and municipality m from\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/7fbd/7fbd3c0c-fcaf-4709-ac9b-7723e0f4ffa7.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3: (a) Posterior mean of the spatial random effect \u03b8.

In a second stage, those estimates have been post-stratified using Expression (7) in order to compute the population estimates at the municipality level. Note that the population of each sex s, age group a and municipality m, Nsam, must be known. Those population totals have been downloaded from the National Institute of Statistics (https://www.ine.es/dynt3/inebase/index.htm?padre=6225). Unlike the results in Figure 3, which represent model estimates that summarize the sample information, the results in Figure 4 are post-stratified to reproduce the population composition of each municipality. Therefore, Figure 3 reproduces the self-perceived health controlling the effects of individual covariates (age group, sex and dwelling strata), while Figure 4 merges all the information for each municipality in order to derive estimates which reproduce both the self-perceived health for each population group and the population composition of each municipality. It can be appreciated that the geographical distribution of the categories corresponding to worse self-perceived health status (\u201cRegular\u201d, \u201cBad\u201d and \u201cVery bad\u201d) resembles closely that of the mean age (last map); that is, areas with worse self-perceived health coincide with those with older population. Thus, Figure 3 is able to filter out the effect of the population composition that Figure 4 does reproduce. The convenience of Figure 3 or Figure 4, in practice, will depend on the goal of the study (if decision makers want to reproduce or filter out the effect of covariates in our estimates). In any case, the proposed model allows both representations to be obtained, which is an important benefit. Finally, we assess the fit of Model (8) by simulating from the posterior predictive distribu-\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/55c0/55c0fa73-0d66-4071-bcab-b9f84f0233c5.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/dd5f/dd5f49fa-d1eb-465d-b52a-691c6aa7346b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/614a/614a211e-8ae5-415d-a780-5c31326318ec.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Bad</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/446e/446e4933-7cd1-4717-9c81-1630568c58b4.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4: Post-stratified posterior means of the percentages, at the area population level, f each category.

As mentioned before, once the model has been fitted, estimates of the probabilities for each sex s, age group a and municipality m (\u02c6\u03c0jsam, j = 1, . . . , J) are obtained. Subsequently, we simulate nsam (the sample size for each sex, age group and municipality) values of the (categorical) response variable from the corresponding posterior predictive distribution. Finally, the estimated number of respondents in each category is the result of adding all the previous results for each sex and age group for each municipality. Specifically, Table 1 contains the corresponding posterior means, 95% prediction intervals and the observed sample percentages for the four municipalities with the largest population in the RV. As observed, there are no large discrepancies between the observed and predicted values, except for the first two categories in Elche.

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for small-area estimation of ordinal variables from health surveys. The main contribution of our proposal is that it allows to analyze ordinal survey-based data at the individual level, estimating the effect of any covariate associated with the response variable. In addition, the proposed methodology simultaneously accounts for spatial dependence and sampling design information at a single stage, and estimates can be made at any desired level of the model hierarchy via poststratification. The representation of the results with maps avoids the detailed, extensive and, on some occasions, unassimilable information normally provided by tables in health survey reports. Moreover, on the one hand, our model provides population estimates of the cell frequencies of the outcome variable at the small-area level. However, on the other hand, it also allows estimating the geographic distribution of the outcome variable, controlling for the effect of some specific covariates that it would be possibly desirable to filter out their effect, such as age or sex. This allows a deeper understanding and analysis of the data set, with enhanced results and tools. These results could be used by public health practitioners to intervene specifically in those areas of the region with a higher risk than the rest. As future lines of research, it would be interesting the development of a methodology based on multivariate models, which would allow us to jointly study sets of ordinal response variables likely to be correlated. In fact, questions in health surveys are usually grouped\nin blocks and these multivariate analyses would allow these variables to be considered as true groups. The multivariate approach will help to estimate the correlation between the different geographical patterns, use that correlation in order to improve the estimation of those geographical patterns and also control the individual-level effect. Furthermore, it would also be interesting to apply this methodology to national, instead of regional, health surveys at the municipality level, even though it would be a challenge due to the expected high computational cost. Finally, another line of research could be to extend the current methodology to the spatio-temporal analysis of consecutive editions of a common health survey in the same study region. As mentioned above, it is common for health surveys to be collected periodically (e.g. every five years), so analyses of this kind could visualize whether there are relevant changes over time.\n# Acknowledgments\nThis study has been funded by Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) through the project \u201cPI19/00219\u201d and co-funded by the European Union.\n# Conflict of interest statement\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n# Data availability statement\nAll the code used for the statistical analysis is shared as a reproducible script at (https://github.com/bsmiguelangel/bayesian-modeling-of-spatial-ordinal-data-from-health-surveys).

        "background": "Health surveys allow exploring health indicators that are valuable from a public health perspective, particularly those not captured by regular health registries. Traditional methods have focused on area-level models which may introduce biases due to the separation of estimation phases. This paper proposes a new Bayesian individual-level model that integrates spatial dependence and sampling design information for small-area estimation of ordinal health indicators.",
        "problem": {
            "definition": "The problem addressed is the lack of effective methods for analyzing ordinal survey-based health indicators in small areas, particularly when traditional area-level models may not adequately account for sampling design and spatial dependence.",
            "key obstacle": "Existing methods often ignore spatial dependence and the complexities of survey sampling designs, leading to potential biases and inaccuracies in estimates."
        },
        "idea": {
            "intuition": "The proposed idea is inspired by the need to effectively analyze ordinal data from health surveys while accounting for spatial attributes and sampling designs.",
            "opinion": "The proposed Bayesian hierarchical model allows for the analysis of ordinal survey-based data at the individual level, simultaneously considering spatial dependence and sampling design.",
            "innovation": "The primary innovation lies in the model's ability to perform small-area estimation of ordinal variables in a single stage, avoiding the biases introduced by traditional two-phase estimation methods."

        "experiments": {
            "evaluation setting": "The methodology was applied to the Health Survey of the Region of Valencia (Spain) from 2016, focusing on self-perceived health indicators across 542 municipalities.",
            "evaluation method": "Model performance was assessed through posterior predictive checks and comparison of predicted values against observed survey responses."

        "conclusion": "The proposed Bayesian hierarchical model effectively analyzes ordinal survey-based data, providing reliable estimates of health indicators at the small-area level while accounting for spatial and sampling design complexities. The methodology enhances understanding of health disparities and can inform public health interventions.",
        "discussion": {
            "advantage": "Key advantages include the ability to analyze ordinal data at the individual level, improve accuracy of estimates, and provide spatially explicit results that can guide public health decisions.",
            "limitation": "One limitation is the potential complexity of the model, which may require substantial computational resources, especially with larger datasets or more complex designs.",
            "future work": "Future research directions include extending the methodology to multivariate models for correlated ordinal responses and applying the approach to national health surveys for broader insights."
