In memory of Roland Glowinski,\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe theory of latent variables in Data Science has been progressing very fast in the recent years, with the objective of reducing the dimension of the dataset. Since data is often associated with dynamic systems, it is natural to consider in this context the framework of identification and estimation of dynamic systems. We refer to [10] for a survey of the main ideas in this direction and to [11] for details, in connection with the Kalman filter in discrete time. The general idea is to consider the latent variable as described by a dynamic system in state space representation. The difficulty is that we need to identify the system while estimating it. The maximum likelihood approach is a natural way to proceed. Here, our algorithm reads as an alternating minimization of a quadratic objective that is nonconvex due to a bilinear term, but convex component-wise. Alternating minimization, a special case of block coordinate descent, is among the simplest algorithms one may think of. However one of the authors has shown in [1a] that alternating minimization encompasses many algorithms (such as gradient descent and its variations). It is also well-known in statistics through the Expectation-Maximization\n(EM) algorithm [8], to which our algorithm corresponds. We refer to [1a, Section 4.8] for more interpretations of EM. Nevertheless, because of the nonconvexity of the objective, we cannot expect the type of global convergence shown in [1a]. A discrete time version for a simpler model of the algorithm can be found in [3]. While most of the papers on this specific topic are indeed in discrete time, there is a huge swath of literature dealing with dynamic systems in continuous time, justifying tackling this setting as well. To simplify the theory and the algorithm, we consider that some aspects of the linear dynamic system are known, in particular the covariance matrices of the noises and the observation matrix.\n# 2. THE MODEL\nWe consider an input-output problem (v(t),y(t))t\u2208[0,T] in state space representation, where we want from a single trajectory to reconstruct the state and its dynamic equation, in other words to perform both estimation and system identification at the same time. We assume that the linear dynamic systems with noise are described by two stochastic differential equations, with all the underlined quantities being known,\nwhere we assume for simplicity that the dimensions of the operators are fixed, for instance chosen minimal through realization theory, see e.g. [3]. More precisely we take x(t) \u2208RN, v(t) \u2208Rd, A \u2208L (RN;RN), B \u2208L (Rd;RN); v(t) being a given deterministic control. There is no optimal control in this setup, but v(.) is an input decided by the controller. The process w(t) is a Wiener process in Rm, with correlation matrix Q, and G \u2208L (Rm;RN). The random variable \u03be is Gaussian with mean x0 \u2208RN and covariance matrix \u03a00. It is independent of the Wiener process w(t). The matrices A and B are not known, although they are in the vicinity of known matrices A0,B0 used as priors. The state of the system x(t) is not observable. We observe instead the process y(t) \u2208Rp where C \u2208L (RN;Rp) is known. The process b(t) is a Wiener process in Rp, with covariance matrix R, also independent from \u03be and w(.). For simplicity, we assume in the sequel that the matrices \u03a00,Q,R are invertible (inverses would then be replaced with pseudo-inverses). The only information is v(t),y(t),t \u2208[0,T]. If A,B were known, the problem would reduce to estimating the evolution of the state x(t). This is the classical Kalman smoothing problem. There are many equivalent ways to solve it. For instance, it is well known that the maximum likelihood is equivalent to the following least square deterministic control problem\nin which the control is the pair (\u03be,w(.)) minimizing the payoff\nIn continuous time, y(t) \u2208L2(T ,Rm) \u201cis reminiscent of the observation process, in fact rather the derivative of the observation process (which, as we know, does not exist)\u201d [2, p180]. Thus it is as if we observed this derivative to do the reconstruction, which is justified since only integrals of it appear in (2.4).\n(2.1) (2.2)\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\nWhen A,B are not known, one way to proceed is to approach (2.3) as a constraint. Th leads to the following formulation. Introduce the argument Z = (A,B,x(.).w(.)) where x(.)  H1(0,T;RN), w(.) \u2208L2(0,T;Rm), and define the norm\nthus Z belongs to a Hilbert space, denoted by Z . Based on (2.4), we then introduce the follow ing functional J over Z to perform the reconstruction. It will be justified in Section 3 throug Bayesian arguments.\nfor given parameters \u03b1,\u03b2 > 0. To alleviate notations, from now on we do not underline the known quantities and we refer the reader to this section. The first term in \u03b1 is a regularizing term in (A,B) using our prior. The second term in \u03b2 is a penalty term if the constraint (2.3) is not satisfied. It can be seen as a regularization of (2.4) (see Remark 3.1 below). The other terms penalize deviations of (x(0),w(t),Cx(t)) from their references (x0,0,y(t)). So the problem amounts to minimizing the functional J(Z) on the Hilbert space Z . Note that (A,B) only appear in the two first terms, while (x(.),w(.)) appear in all terms but the two first. This suggests to do an alternating minimization of J as in Section 5 below. However J is non convex due to the term Ax(t), so we cannot hope to reach a global minimum for every initialization. We will first justify the choice of J in Section 3 and then prove the existence of a minimum in Section 4, giving also the first-order optimality conditions that it satisfies. Note that a similar methodology can be replicated if we consider some other matrices to be unknown (e.g. C or G). In the discrete time case, the problem of estimating simultaneously two matrices while minimizing an expression of their product has been considered in [9].\nWe follow here the presentation of [6, Section 2] for the classical derivation of a least squares problem from a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of system based on a model (M) and observations operator (O). To avoid technicalities, we do the justification for random variables over a finite set, thus not for the stochastic differential equations (2.1)-(2.2) with Brownian motions which we considered. However the ideas and results extend to infinite dimensions [5]. To obtain the objective function (2.6), we consider that (2.2) is an equation of the form\nY = O(x(.),w(.))+\u03b7obs\nThe key reason for the methodological difference when moving to continuous time is reminded in [5] \u201cWhile in the finite-dimensional setting, the prior and posterior distribution of such statistical problems can typically be described by densities w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure, such a characterisation is no longer possible in the infinite dimensional spaces [...] no analogue of the Lebesgue measure exists in infinite dimensional spaces.\u201d However Gaussian measures can still serve as a replacement in our case [4]. They correspond here to the Wiener processes we consider. Radon\u2013Nikodym derivatives are then obtained through Girsanov\u2019s theorem [2, Chapter 6.5].\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\nwhere Y = (yt)t\u2208T , \u03b7obs \u223cN (0,R), R(s,t) = \u03b4s=tR(t). Similarly we relax (2.3) by introducing a model error\n0 = M(x(.),w(.),A,B)+\u03b7model\nwhere \u03b7model \u223cN (0,Id/\u03b2). We put a Gaussian prior \u00b50 on (x(.),w(.),A,B) of the form x(0) \u223cN (x0,\u03a00), w(.) \u223cN (0,Q) with Q(s,t) = \u03b4s=tQ(t), A \u223cN (A0,Id/\u03b1) and B \u223c N (B0,Id/\u03b1). Thus, by Bayes\u2019 theorem, the posterior distribution is given by\nwhere \u2225y(.)\u22252 R = (R\u22121y(.)).y(.). The MAP estimator is then given by argmaxZ\u2208Z \u00b5\u2217(dZ), and thus equivalently by minimizing the log-density, argminZ\u2208Z \u2212log\u00b5\u2217(dZ) which is precisely (2.6). More formally, in continuous time, to derive (2.6) as the problem solved by the MAP, one can just apply [5, Corollary 3.10] to identify J as an Onsager-Machlup functional. Remark 3.1 (RKHS constraint in the limit case). Interestingly [6, Proposition 1] recalls that for \u03b2 \u2192\u221e(vanishing model noise case), we have that the accumulation points of the optimum \u02c6Z\u03b2 all satisfy (2.3). For given A,B, (2.3) says that x(.) belongs to the affine vector space of functions H = {x(.)|\u2203w(.), dx/dt = Ax+Bv+Gw, \ufffdT 0 Q\u22121w(t).w(t)dt < \u221e}. This space can be equipped with a quadratic norm based on \u03a0\u22121 0 (x(0)).(x(0))+ \ufffdT 0 Q\u22121w(t).w(t)dt + \ufffdT 0 C\u2217R\u22121Cx(t).x(t)dt and, once the affine term is removed, has a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) structure. We refer to [1b] for more on this topic. Since we consider \u03b2 \u0338= \u221e, we authorize x(.) to live beyond this RKHS. In other words the \u201cnoise\u201d term w(.) can be understood as a control, and by introducing \u03b2 we assume implicitly some extra noise on the model that was not present in (2.1). Moreover \u03b2 \u2192\u221eimplies that the minimizer \u02c6w(.) is equal to G\u2296(dx/dt \u2212Ax(t) \u2212Bv(t)), with G\u2296the pseudo-inverse of G for the Euclidean norm. Consequently the objective simplifies to \u02dcJ(A,B,x(.)) = \u03b1 tr((A\u2212A0)(A\u2212A0)\u2217+(B\u2212B0)(B\u2212B0)\u2217)+ 1 \u03a0\u22121  (x(0)\u2212x0).(x(0)\u2212x0)\nwhere it is effectively the noise w(.) of (2.1) that is penalized, and \u02dcJ corresponds to the trad tional least square estimator used in Kalman smoothing [7, 1b].\nRemark 3.2 (Relation with EM). It is well-known that the Expectation-Maximization (EM algorithm is an alternating minimization of a log-likelihood [8], which is the form of algorithm we propose in Section 5. More precisely, given a probability space (U , \u00af\u00b5), the relative entropy (Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence) is defined as\nfor \u00b5 absolutely continuous w.r.t. \u00af\u00b5 and +\u221eotherwise. In our case, we assume our observations Y to be sampled according to \u00af\u03bd and X serves as a latent, hidden random variable X \u2208(X , \u00af\u00b5).\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\nWe posit a joint distribution p\u03b8(dx,dy) parametrized by an element \u03b8 = (A,B) of the set \u0398 = L (RN;RN)\u00d7L (Rd;RN). As presented in [8], the goal is to infer \u03b8 by solving\nwhere pY p\u03b8(dy) = \ufffd X p\u03b8(dx,dy) is the marginal in Y . The EM approach starts by minimizing a surrogate function of \u03b8 upperbounding KL(\u00af\u03bd|pY p\u03b8). For any \u03c0 \u2208\u03a0(\u2217, \u00af\u03bd) = {\u03c0 | pY\u03c0 = \u00af\u03bd}, by the data processing inequality, i.e. KL of the marginals is smaller than KL of the plans,\nThe above formulation consists in (3.4), optimizing the parameters \u03b8n at step n (M-step), and then (3.5), optimizing the joint distribution \u03c0n+1 at step n + 1 (E-step). This is actually what we propose as algorithm to minimize J by minimizing alternatively in X = (x(.),w(.)) and \u03b8 = (A,B), J being obtained as previously as the KL divergence of Gaussian measures. However making explicit the (Gaussian) measures underlying our parametrization goes beyond our scope and we now move to the study of our specific least-squares J.\nProof. The functional J(Z) is continuous on Z . It is also weakly lower semicontinuous. Indeed if Zn \u21c0Z (weakly), then An \u2192A in L (RN;RN), Bn \u2192B in L (Rd;RN), xn(.) \u21c0x(.) in H1(0,T;RN), wn(.) \u21c0w(.) in L2(0,T;Rm). We deduce that (xn(.))n is equicontinuous, hence, by Ascoli\u2019s theorem, xn(.) \u2192x(.) in C0([0,T];RN). It follows that Anxn(.)\u2192Ax(.) in C0([0,T];RN) and dxn dt \u21c0dx dt in L2(0,T;RN). Consequently we have\n+ 1 2\u03a0\u22121 0 (x(0)\u2212x0).(x(0)\u2212x0)+ 1 2 \ufffdT 0 R\u22121(y(t)\u2212Cx(t)).(y(t)\u2212Cx(t))dt.\nFrom the weak lower semicontinuity of the norm in the spaces L2(0,T;RN) and L2(0,T;Rm), we conclude easily that J(Z) \u2264liminf J(Zn). If we consider a minimizing sequence Zn, namely J(Zn) \u2192inf J(Z) \u22650.\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\nThen, since J(Zn) \u2264J(0) for n sufficiently large, it follows easily that the sequence Zn is bounded in Z . Since weakly closed bounded sets are weakly compact, we can extract a subsequence, still denoted Zn \u21c0\ufffdZ in Z weakly. From weak lower semicontinuity of J, we obtain J(\ufffdZ) \u2264liminfJ(Zn) = inf J(Z). This implies that \ufffdZ is a minimum of J(Z), which concludes the proof.\u25a0 \u25a1\nProposition 4.2. The gradient DJ(Z) \u2208Z is given by the formula\n\ufffd in which Z = (A,B,x(.),w(.)), \ufffdZ = (\ufffdA, \ufffdB,\ufffdx(.), \ufffdw(.)) and q(t) is defined by \ufffd \ufffd\nProof. From the definition of the G\u02c6ateaux differential in Z, we must check that\n \ufffd \ufffd is equal to the right hand side of (4.1). We fix Z, \ufffdZ with q(t) defined by (4.2). As easily checked we can write\n \ufffd \ufffd is equal to the right hand side of (4.1). We fix Z, \ufffdZ with q(t) defined by (4.2). As easily check we can write \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\n\ufffd \ufffd We then replace \ufffdx(t) with \ufffdx(0) + \ufffdt 0 d ds\ufffdx(s)ds. We perform a change of integration and some rearrangements to obtain the relation (4.1). \u25a1 If \ufffdZ = (\ufffdA, \ufffdB,\ufffdx(.), \ufffdw(.)) is a point of minimum for J(Z), it follows from formula (4.1) that the corresponding \ufffdq(t) defined by\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n(4.4)\n(4.5)\nsatisfies\n\ufffd with \ufffdw(t) given by\n \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd Note that (4.7) has an interesting structure, decomposing the optimal \ufffdA (resp. \ufffdB) as a sum o rank 1 tensor products between the covector q and the trajectory x (resp. covector q and contro v).\nThe relations (4.6), (4.7) can be interpreted as a fixed point problem for the pair (\ufffdA, \ufffdB). If we fix the pair (\ufffdA, \ufffdB) then we obtain the pair (\ufffdx(.), \ufffdq(.)) by solving the system of forward backward equations (4.6). Next for fixed (\ufffdx(.), \ufffdq(.)) we obtain (\ufffdA, \ufffdB) by the formulas (4.7). This corresponds also to an alternating minimization of J, which happens in two steps. The first part is associated to a control problem, formulated as a calculus of variations problem\nmin A,B L(A,B;\ufffdx(.), \ufffdw(.)) := \u03b1 2 tr((A\u2212A0)(A\u2212A0)\u2217+(B\u2212B0)(B\u2212B0)\u2217)\n(4.6)\n\ufffd \ufffdq(T) = 0,\n(4.7)\n(4.8)\n(5.1)\n(5.2)\nIt is important to notice that the two problems (5.1), (5.2) are convex quadratic and have a unique solution, whereas the original problem (2.6) is not convex. This highlights the usefulness of algorithm that we propose to find a local optimum \ufffdZ of J(Z). We initialize the algorithm with (A0,B0). For n \u22650, knowing An,Bn we define uniquely the pair (xn(.),wn(.)) which minimizes K(An,Bn;x(.),w(.)). This leads immediately to the existence and uniqueness of the pair xn(.),qn(.) solution of the system of forward-backward relations \ufffd \ufffd\nwith wn(t) given by\nUsing (5.3)-(5.5), the term in wn canceling out with one of those in qn, we can rewrite the equation (5.6) as follows by factorizing\nOur main result is the convergence of the alternating minimization scheme to extremal points for the first-order optimality conditions.\nOur main result is the convergence of the alternating minimization scheme to extremal points for the first-order optimality conditions. Theorem 5.1. The sequence J(Zn) is decreasing. The sequence Zn is bounded and Zn+1\u2212Zn \u2192 0. Limits of converging subsequences of Zn are solutions of the set of necessary conditions (4.6),\nTheorem 5.1. The sequence J(Zn) is decreasing. The sequence Zn is bounded and Zn+1\u2212Zn \u2192 0. Limits of converging subsequences of Zn are solutions of the set of necessary conditions (4.6),\nProof. We compute the two differences K(An+1,Bn+1;xn(.),wn(.))\u2212K(An+1,Bn+1;xn+1(.),wn+1(.)) and L(An,Bn;xn(.),wn(.)) \u2212L(An+1,Bn+1;xn(.),wn(.)) which are nonnegative numbers, since (xn+1(.),wn+1(.)) minimizes K(An+1,Bn+1;x(.),w(.)) and (An+1,Bn+1) minimizes L(A,B;xn(.),wn(.)). Since we know the minimizers, we can use the fact that a quadratic function f(z), with Hessian\n(5.3)\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n(5.6)\n(5.7)\nH and minimum \u00afz, satisfies f(z) \u2212f(\u00afz) = 1 2(z \u2212\u00afz)\u2217H(z \u2212\u00afz). This is a completion of square argument. Consequently, we have\nSimilarly we can write also\nwhich is a nonnegative quantity. It follows that the sequence J(Zn) is decreasing. Since it is nonnegative, it converges. From the relation (5.10) we see that Zn \u2212Zn+1 \u21920 in \u2225.\u2225Z . Since J(Zn) \u2264J(Z0), the sequence Zn is bounded in Z . If we extract a subsequence which converges weakly to \ufffdZ, also noted Zn without loss of generality, then An \u2192\ufffdA,Bn \u2192\ufffdB and xn(.) \u2192\ufffdx(.) in H1(0,T;RN) weakly, hence strongly in C0([0,T];RN). From (5.3), qn(.) \u2192\ufffdq(,) in H1(0,T;RN) weakly and strongly in C0([0,T];RN). Therefore, from (5.5) wn(.) \u2192\ufffdw(.) in L2(0,T;RN). Finally Zn \u2192\ufffdZ. We can thus take the limit in equations (5.3), (5.7) and obtain that \ufffdZ is solution of the set of equations (4.6), (4.7). This concludes the proof. \u25a1\n(5.8)\n(5.9)\n(5.10)\nThe first author was funded by the European Research Council (grant REAL 947908).
