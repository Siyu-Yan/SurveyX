CONA is a flexible framework designed to leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporate DIKW (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom) hierarchy to automatically instruct and optimise presentation content, anticipate potential audience inquiries, and provide context-aware answers that adaptive to the knowledge level of the audience group. The unique aspect of the CONA paradigm lies in its combination of an independent advisory mechanism and a recursive feedback loop rooted on the DIKW hierarchy. This synergy significantly enhances context-aware contents, ensuring they are accessible and easily comprehended by the audience. This paradigm is an early pioneer to explore new methods for knowledge dissemination and communication in the LLM era, offering effective support for everyday knowledge sharing scenarios. We conduct experiments on a range of audience roles, along with materials from various disciplines using GPT4. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated that the proposed CONA paradigm achieved remarkable performance compared to the outputs guided by conventional prompt engineering.\n# 1 Introduction\nConventional knowledge dissemination and sharing methods such as oral presentation in a seminar or classroom teaching typically involve a presenter (e.g., lecturer), preparing dedicated content (lesson plan) under a topic (history lesson) for a specific group of audience (students). This approach, however, suffers from several issues including: 1) lacking capability to adapt the content to individual understanding level of the audience; 2) Quality of the prepared lesson plan highly depends on the skills of the presenter, and 3) Quality of audience interaction (e.g., Q&A session) heavily relies on the presenter\u2019s proficiency and experiences of that specific topic. For instance, experienced presenter may foresee common questions from the target audience and prepare suitable responses in advance, while novices might find it challenging to respond effectively or elucidate complex concepts. In the past two decades, modern technologies such as computer and touch screen tablets have been used to enable digital animation and interaction in knowledge dissemination Bondi and Cacchiani (2021). However, despite these technological strides, effectively disseminating knowledge to accommodate specific audience groups and ensure a high level of understanding remains a challenging task. Recently, the development of Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-like Large Language Models (LLMs) Brown et al. (2020); Chowdhery et al. (2022); OpenAI (2023b); Touvron et al. (2023); Zhao et al. (2023) has shown potentials to improve the quality of knowledge dissemination for given audience group via prompt engineering. Specifically, GPT4 OpenAI (2023b) has shown its powerful reasoning ability and conciseness in assisting tasks such as identifying key points and summarising\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/16cc/16cc2105-707c-4402-83cf-7af9820c9304.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Comparison: standard knowledge dissemination (left) vs. proposed CONA paradigm (right) in DIKW hierarchy (centre). Light blue texts & dashed arrows show shallow to deep knowledge dissemination. Red exclamation mark & blue tick mark represent effectiveness in reaching DIKW.</div>\narticles. However, these GPT based downstream investigations predominantly focus on self-learning aids, rare attempts have been made to utilise GPT-like LLMs specifically for improving the quality of knowledge dissemination and sharing. In this work, we propose a novel CONtext-Aware paradigm, namely CONA, that uses GPT for scenario-agnostic knowledge dissemination under the well known DIKW (Data-InformationKnowledge-Wisdom) hierarchy Rowley (2007). As shown in Figure 1, the DIKW pyramid illustrates four levels of human learning from shallow to deep knowledge. From a teaching perspective, the learning process could also be classified into three types: 1) ordinary communication which often involves data and information level knowledge exchange; 2) normal teaching which additionally contains knowledge level dissemination; and 3) professional teaching which guides students to learn wisdom (or evaluated understanding, integrated knowledge) Wallace (2007). In traditional teaching practice, even with the assistance of LLM (left panel of Figure 1), wisdom and knowledge level teaching still can not be consistently achieved. In contrast, CONA is a generalised framework aims to achieve wisdom level teaching via systematic integration of DIKW hierarchy in LLM (right panel of Figure 1). In particular, CONA is able to simulate certain audience group via an innovative knowledge blocking (KB) scheme, which effectively supports iterative auto-guidance and role swap (see next section) and finally achieves context-aware wisdom level teaching with teaching contents adaptive to the unique characteristics of the intended audience group. Hence, the CONA framework represents a substantial improvement in knowledge dissemination by ensuring content is not only appropriately complex, but also tailored to the audience\u2019s distinct attributes. As a pioneer work to explore new context-aware instruction paradigm for general human communication in the era of LLM, CONA allows any presenter to achieve wisdom level teaching agnostic to teaching scenarios. Additionally, CONA contributes in the following three aspects: \u2022 A knowledge blocking scheme is introduced to selectively inhibit GPT agents\u2019 access to specific knowledge, allowing stable simulation of diverse roles and thereby enhances the versatility and effectiveness of GPT in future educational downstream tasks. \u2022 A Q&A auto-guidance scheme is proposed to systematically guide audience agents to learn materials following the steps of data\u2192information\u2192knowledge\u2192wisdom, ensuring effective wisdom level communication. \u2022 A role swap practice scheme is invented to force audience to iteratively answer domain\nThe rest of the paper will detail the CONA paradigm (Section 2), describe experimental setup and report results (Section 3), and discuss interesting findings and future directions (Section 4).\nCONA paradigm (Figure 2) contains three functional components: knowledge blocking (KB) to generate desired agents; DIKW Q&A Auto-guidance to reach wisdom level communication; and Role Swap Practice (RSP) to achieve context-aware results adaptive to audience characteristics.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/e753/e753cf59-b7e1-43eb-9ff2-b0294ba157b1.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: Illustration of CONA paradigm (light green panel) and a comparison with standard teaching route (light pink panel). The input to LLM are teaching materials and audience characteristics. The standard teaching route generates standard lecture notes, while CONA produces enhanced contextaware lecture notes and reference Q&A for lecture preparation.</div>\nCONA executes in a sequential manner. Initially, KB takes in both raw lecture materials and audience information to automatically produce identity and keyword blocking prompts and form three distinct agent roles: the lecturer, the audience, and the independent advisers. Both lecturer and advisers are field experts of a specific subject while audience are knowledge blocked to their comprehension level. Following this, the Auto-guidance prompts the lecturer and the audience to participate in a Q&A session under DIKW hierarchy, progressively approaching wisdom level communication. Subsequently, Q&As at varying DIKW stages (depicted as red chat bulbs in Figure 2) are iteratively optimised in RSP. Specifically, the audience is required to respond to the questions they initially posed, while a group of independent advisers provide feedback. The ultimate goal is to achieve context-aware Q&A and stably produce wisdom level context-aware lecture notes.\nThe KB scheme refines a (GPT) agent\u2019s access to domain-specific and level-specific knowledge via strategic prompt engineering to create more contextually realistic agents. This process incorporates two primary strategies: Identity Blocking, which restricts agent\u2019s overall knowledge level (e.g., primary school student, undergraduate, expert); Keyword Blocking, that limits agent\u2019s access to keyword-related knowledge derived from the summaries of the original input materials. To assess the effectiveness of KB, three levels of knowledge tests are designed to progressively weaken KB strength, using Identity Blocking (same for Keyword Blocking) as an example:\nStep 1: Generate N keywords (Group A) which are far beyond agent\u2019s assigned knowledge level and generate another N keywords (Group B) conceptually easier for them. Shuffling the 2N keywords and prompting the agent to recognise them.\nStep 2: Generate definitions for Group A\u2019s keywords (excluding themselves). The agent is then asked to match the definitions with the corresponding Group A\u2019s keywords. Step 3: Adopt prompts such as \"try your best\", \"act like a teacher and teach your friend about ...,\" or \"use all your imagination to\" to encourage the agent to explain Group A\u2019s keywords.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f972/f972387f-3608-4deb-9240-1cb32b880890.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n\nFigure 3: Example of Knowledge Blocking using agents generated by both GPT3.5 Turbo and GPT4. The green tick and red cross indicate whether the agent\u2019s knowledge is successfully blocked. As exemplified in Figure 3, we assessed KB in both GPT3.5 Turbo and GPT4, blocking an agent to be a primary school student using designed role-play prompts, on which both models successfully \u2018act\u2019 the assigned role. We then block the agent\u2019s computer science and calculus knowledge, and GPT4 demonstrated superior blocking ability even it is asked complex questions (last question in Figure 3). In contrast, GPT3.5 Turbo did well in simple questions but failed in the complex ones.\n# 2.2 DIKW Q&A Auto-guidance\nven the finely knowledge-blocked agents, the lecturer and the audience are then engaged in a Q&A ssion performed by the Auto-guidance scheme. This scheme enables the audience to post questions the lecturer and learn from the answers. This interaction leads to progressive improvement in e quality of questions asked by the audience, evolving from basic data level to wisdom level estions under DIKW pyramid. In practice, questions is primarily divided into three categories: alogy-based questions, problem solving questions, and dilemma-oriented questions. The deliberate sign of these question types allows for an in-depth exploration of the subject matter, thereby stering a comprehensive wisdom level understanding of the topic. This scheme particularly adopts e following four strategies to progressively achieve wisdom level communication in Q&A: \u2022 Bilateral active feedback is an interactive parsing mechanism to encourage agents\u2019 interaction, e.g. asking whether a specific concept is too complex. This effectively prevent the audience from exhausting their question quota on low DIKW level confusions. \u2022 Consistent role affirmation is a reminder mechanism to maintain agent\u2019s functional role. Each round of Q&A includes a reminder such as \"As an AI expert ...\", to aid GPT in mitigating the impact of random interference, especially in a long context. \u2022 Self-introduction prompts both lecturer and audience to share their respective backgrounds to foster mutual understanding and alignment when their conversation stagnates. \u2022 Process countdown limits the number of Q&A to encourage the agents to self-regulate the questioning process. Unlike case with no question limit that an agent dwells on basic knowledge, it prompts the audience to distribute questions on in-depth knowledge effectively.\n# 2.3 Role Swap Practice and Independent Feedback\nThe RSP scheme can significantly improve the context-awareness of the contents via a recursive answering practice. At each DIKW Q&A stage, the Q&A roles are swapped between the audience and an adviser, in which the latter is an independent agent with knowledge equivalent to the lecturer RSP scheme prompts the audience to respond to domain-specific questions in their own words, while\nthe adviser assesses the responses and provides feedback. As a result of the recursive cycle, the content becomes context-aware, aligning better to the unique comprehension level of the audience. Additionally, the feedback from the independent advisers play an important role to continuously improve the audience\u2019s answers. The adviser not only extends the scope of existing questions but also provides constructive feedback and introduces challenges. As shown in the top right corner of Figure 2, CONA is designed to generate multiple advisers, ensuring a new independent adviser is engaged in each round of the RSP. This approach mitigates the risk of bias in the assessment of the audience\u2019s answers by preventing any prior information from influencing the subsequent RSP rounds. Our empirical experiments reveals that three to four rounds of the RSP are typically adequate for generating context-aware contents, shown in Table 1.\n# 3 Experimental Results\nThis section outlines our experimental setup and results, comparing CONA\u2019s primary components to the standard LLM-assisted teaching method both quantitatively and qualitatively. We used 8 presentation scripts and 9 audience agent roles. Check the Supplementary Material A.2 for experimental setting details and prompting engineering hints.\n# 3.1 Assessment of Q&A Auto-guidance Scheme\n# 3.1.1 Quantative Analysis\nFigure 4 reports the performance comparison between CONA and the baseline (using standard promp techniques) under the same input materials and audience information.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4718/471894ab-4d43-4515-b54a-699b75158822.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(a)</div>\nFigure 4: Comparative analysis of DIKW Q&A Auto-guidance scheme (green circle line) and standard prompting baseline (blue dashed triangle line).

(b) presents the average question count for the four DIKW levels, revealing a more uniform distribution using the DIKW Q&A Guidance method compared to the baseline. We assign scores from 1 to 4 for each level of the DIKW model. For the metrics, please check the Supplementary Material A.1. A question-answer (Q&A) pair is scored based on the highest level reached in the answer. Unlike traditional methods that often stay at the Data level, our CONA model encourages a deeper discussion, even reaching the Wisdom level. Initially, Q&A pairs (QA1-QA3) handle the problem at the Information level, often using analogies for knowledge bridging. As the discussion continues, later Q&A pairs (QA4, QA5) either explore broader topics or dive into more specific inquiries. This phase\u2019s increased fluctuation shows a link between the audience\u2019s knowledge domain and the topic. When comparing the stability of CONA and traditional methods, we see that CONA evenly distributes discussions across all four DIKW levels,\n# 3.1.2 Qualitative Analysis\nOur qualitative analysis of the Q&A example in Figure 5, which presents \u2019Tasmanian Devil Cancer Evolution Conroy (2023)\u2019 to an \u2019AI expert\u2019, demonstrates the effectiveness of our DIKW autoguidance approach. The agent\u2019s self-introduction provides essential context, allowing the presenter to adapt their language to the audience, meeting our expectations. The discussion progresses as the AI expert asks for an analogy to understand complex terms. The presenter responds with an AI-related comparison, deepening the conversation. The dialogue advances when the AI expert explores potential AI solutions to the problems. It peaks when the presenter shares their viewpoint.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/eb83/eb83f9d7-943d-4bdc-ac12-a81dbded70b6.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 5: Comparative analysis of the DIKW communication level in Q&A sessions.

For example, the analogy feedback loops start with a lower score in the educational text level than others, with the professional level scoring highest. This difference reflects audience understanding, not text difficulty. For instance, primary school students may struggle with feedback loop suggestions due to their limited knowledge level, resulting in lower initial scores and slower improvement, which matches real-world audience\u2019s knowledge acquisition process. In contrast, the problem-solving feedback loop shows quicker score convergence. While the professional level achieves the highest average score only in the final round, the other levels converge by the third round, albeit with lower scores. This rapid assimilation is due to the audience posing problems\nOur numerical results, presented in Table 1, demonstrate varying score improvements across different feedback loop scenarios.

Full Text can be viewed in Supplementary Material A.3.1.\nfrom their field of expertise, allowing for quick absorption and implementation of feedback. The ethical dilemma scenario showcases a similar trend. Experts initially biased towards a specific viewpoint show a shift towards neutrality after considering other experts\u2019 challenges. This matches our goal for managing ethical dilemmas, where the adviser should steer the audience towards neutrality and promote thorough problem analysis.\n# 3.2.2 Qualitative Analysis\nOur analysis of textual enhancements from CONA is presented in the right panel of Figure 5. The DIKW auto-guidance process improves the communication level in the generated Q&A pairs. However, initial answers might lack depth and specificity. For instance, gene comparison explanation was broadly tied to \u2018algorithms\u2019, failing to offer detailed insights for the audience.\nUsing the proposed RSP scheme, the resulting \u2019malware\u2019 analogy and the use of networks to explain gene transportation provide a more detailed information level, improving audience comprehension. Similarly, for problem-solving, the initial response was general, without specific solutions or algorithms. Introducing our problem-solving feedback loop significantly improves this, producing a more detailed, step-by-step problem-solving approach. In the dilemma section, sometimes the lecturer sides with the author, limiting the audience\u2019s exposure to diverse perspectives. This bias restricts audience\u2019s understanding on the topic. To rectify this, we applies the dilemma feedback loop. The modified response introduces multiple perspectives, fostering neutrality and presenting a balanced solution. This method effectively enriches audience\u2019s understanding, facilitating a more comprehensive topic engagement.\n# 3.3 Assessment of CONA Synthetic Lecture Note\nCompared to traditional one-shot prompts, CONA generates wisdom level and audience-specific contents, leading to improved understanding and communication. Figure 6 demonstrates a case study of \"Loss of Touch Sensation Cataldo (2023)\" lecture for a \u2018Painting Artists\u2019 audience. Unlike standard notes that only generate Data level explanation, the one improved by CONA uses art-related analogy like \u2019orchestra\u2019 and \u2019piano tuner\u2019 to clarify complex terms, enhancing audience understanding. It then addresses art-related questions, such as art therapy\u2019s role in treating somatosensory disorders. This sparks the audience\u2019s curiosity, encouraging their further exploration of the topic. CONA also shows impressive performance to trigger critical thinking by introducing dilemma topics and providing balanced viewpoints for a well-rounded discussion (the block with Wisdom level contents highlighted in blue in Figure 6). From our empirical studies, the improved notes achieve wisdom level knowledge under CONA paradigm, which significantly improves the readability of the original materials.\n# 4 Conclusions and Discussions\nTo conclude, the novel CONA paradigm and the pioneering experiments conducted across various disciplines using GPT, have yielded valuable perspectives on knowledge dissemination and communication in the LLM era. Most importantly, our findings reveal that learners of all levels, even primary school students who only understand simple Data and Information level, are capable of achieving wisdom-level learning under strategic guidance. The CONA paradigm notably outperforms the outputs produced by the same GPT under conventional prompt engineering. All results reinforce the advancements in knowledge dissemination and sharing facilitated by the proposed CONA paradigm. Our study has some limitations, which also yields new insights for potential future work. Firstly, we found quantitative metrics are very limited for this new research direction as there\u2019s no bench-marking dataset or standard metric exist. It would be helpful to incorporate more comprehensive quantitative assessment methods to evaluate factors such as audience comprehension and discussion quality etc. Secondly, upon the release this paper, GPT-4 API we adopted is still limited by an 8k context window. We anticipate this will be mitigated quickly, for example, alternative models such as Claude Anthropic (2023) now accommodates up to 100k tokens within its context window. This will open up new possibilities for more complex and in-depth discussions across a diverse range of audiences and within broader contexts. Thirdly, we only employed Analogy, Problem Solving, and Ethical Dilemmas to assess each stage of the DIKW hierarchy, this could be extended to other forms of assessments, including Case Studies and Long-term Implications, to further augment our assessment framework. Lastly, we plan to implement Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF) OpenAI (2023c) Bai et al. (2022) into the evaluation process of our future work. This approach brings a broader spectrum of perspectives and reduces individual biases in the evaluations. With the findings of this work and the potential for continuous improvements, we anticipate that the CONA paradigm will facilitate more complex and in-depth discussions across diverse audiences and broader contexts. CONA may also make a positive societal contribution. We hope the CONA paradigm could serve as an useful pioneer work for reshaping education, communication, and general knowledge dissemination in the era of LLM, allowing learners of all levels to engage with complex concepts more effectively, accelerating their cognitive development and fostering a deeper understanding of the world. Furthermore, the proposed paradigm has the potential to lower the barriers for general public to access knowledge, as this approach was found to be less dependent on traditional, resource-intensive teaching methodologies.\n# A Supplementary Material\n# A.1 Evaluation Metrics\nIn CONA, we develop a comprehensive set of assessment metrics, both quantitative and qualitative, under the DIKW framework to assess generated contents. As shown in Figure 7, a range of assessment question types are available in each DIKW level Rowley (2007); Fricke (2009). In this paper, we adopt one question type per level, as highlighted in the figure, though it can be readily extended to accommodate other types for other studies.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/9854/9854502f-352b-4ee3-934d-47aae8c2c665.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 7: The evaluation metrics of CONA under the DIKW hierarch</div>\nSpecifically, the following four types of assessments are employed\n\u2022 Data Matching (D level) provides data points to the audience, who is required to align the data with their respective descriptions or categories. It aims to improve the audience\u2019s recall and recognition ability on specific data points from the article. \u2022 Analogy (I level) requires audiences to use domain knowledge to clarify the meaning of article terms, concepts, or ideas. This assessment aims to integrate the new knowledge into existing cognitive structures. \u2022 Problem Solving (K level) involves presenting a scenario or problem tied to the article\u2019s domain and requires application of learned concepts with the audience\u2019s background. It aims to improve the audience\u2019s deeper understanding at the knowledge level. \u2022 Ethical Dilemma (W level) introduces a morally complex situation relates to the domain. Audience are asked to justify their decisions or actions, encouraging reflection on potential long-term implications with considering diverse perspectives at a relatively neutral position.\n# A.2 Experiment Setting\n\u2022 LLM: We select GPT4 OpenAI (2023a) as the primary model for this study as it exhibits superior proficiency in conciseness and reasoning. As its training data only contains materials prior to September 2021, we select reading materials to guarantee the model\u2019s responses in all of our tests are free from any prior exposure, and the results are solely based on GPT4\u2019s own reasoning and understanding abilities. \u2022 Materials: We select 8 very recent (2023) presentation scripts from www.ted.com and www.nature.com, with a constrained content length of 600-1000 words. The materials are classified into three categories: 1) Educational topics, includes \u2018Continental Drift\u2019 Koehl (2023) and \u2018Ecological Role of Beavers\u2019 Hood (2023); 2) Commonsense topics, includes \u2018Physiological Impact of Stress\u2019 Bergquist (2019), \u2018Lost of Touch Sensation\u2019 Cataldo (2023), and \u2018Detrimental Effects of Smoking\u2019 Sudhir; 3) Professional topics, includes \u2018Black Holes\u2019 Castelvecchi (2023), \u2018Tasmanian Devil Cancer Evolution\u2019 Conroy (2023)\u2019, and \u2018Astrophysics Opportunities via Starship\u2019 Witze (2023). More information can be found in Table 2. \u2022 Audience: We select 9 roles of audience in the test: a primary school student for the educational topics; a software developer, an obstetrician, a chemistry teacher, an interior designer for the commonsense topics; and an AI specialist, a historical scholar, a political scientist, and a geology professor for the professional topics. More information can be found in Table 2.\n\u2022 Q&A Process: We adopt in-context learning Dong et al. (2022) to craft prompts. This approach gives LLM more detailed contexts along with examples for clear guides. It is helpful for complex tasks such as analogy to identify the correct target analogy object. \u2022 Feedback loop: We adopt self-consistency approach Wang et al. (2022) to yield multiple outcomes for quantitative assessment. A trimming step is conducted to remove both the highest and lowest scores before computing the mean value over repeated trials. This aims to produce statistically robust assessment by mitigating inherent stochasticity within LLM.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">: Information for the presentation material choice and agent Roles for</div>\nTopic\nLevel\nAudience1\nAudience2\nSource\nContinental Drift\nEducational\nPrimary School\nStudent\n-\nTED\nEcological Role of Beavers\nEducational\nPrimary School\nStudent\n-\nTED\nImpact of Stress\nCommonsense\nSoftware\nDevelopver\nObsetrician\nTED\nLost of Touch Sensation\nCommonsense\nPainting\nArtist\n-\nTED\nEffects of Smoking\nCommonsense\nChemistry\nTeacher\nInterior\nDesigner\nTED\nBlack Holes\nProfessional\nPainting\nArtist\nHistory\nScholar\nNature\nTasmanian Devil Cancer\nProfessional\nAI Expert\nPolitics\nScientist\nNature\nStarship\nProfessional\nGeology\nProfessor\n-\nNature\n# A.3 CONA Example\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Table 3: CONA DIWK Auto Guidance after RSP for presentation \u2019Lost of Touch Sensation Cataldo (2023)\u2019 with audience Painting Artist</div>\nQ1\n[Quesion]: Thank you for the presentation, Lecturer Joe! As an art student, I\u2019m not\nfamiliar with some terms you mentioned. For my first question, can you please explain\nthe concept of \"somatosensory system\" in a way that can be better understood from an\nartistic perspective or provide an analogy?\nA1\n[Answer]: Of course! The somatosensory system can be compared to an orchestra,\nwith each distinct receptor playing a unique instrument to form a harmonious sensory\nsymphony. Like the collection of musicians and their instruments, various receptors\nsuch as touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception combine their roles cooperatively,\ncreating a seamless blend of sensory experiences. As a conductor leads an orchestra,\nthe nerve fibers coordinate the receptors, forming a vivid sensory world for individuals\nto navigate. In essence, this sensory orchestra serves to bring us a clear perception and\ncarefully guides us through our day-to-day experiences.\nQ2\n[Quesion]: Your explanation using the art gallery analogy was very insightful and easier\nto understand. For my next question, could you elaborate on the role of \"nociceptors\"\nwith this updated analogy that can be grasped within an art gallery context?\nPart\nQA Text\nQ2\n[Answer]: Certainly! Think of nociceptors as individual guards stationed along the\nborders of an art gallery. In this gallery, each artwork represents a different sensation\n- touch, temperature, or body awareness (proprioception). The constant vigilance of\nthese guards (nociceptors) ensures that the valuable art pieces are protected by detecting\npotentially destructive behaviors around them.\nThe alarms each guard uses vary in tone and intensity, similar to how myelinated and\nunmyelinated nociceptors transmit unique pain signals to the brain. Louder and intense\nalarms are triggered by myelinated nociceptors (for sharp pain), while unmyelinated\nnociceptors send gentler reminders in case the matter is not grave yet (dull pain). By\nfacilitating appropriate internal responses to discomfort or danger, nociceptors serve the\nhuman body ceaselessly just like a reliable security system in the art gallery.\nQ3\n[Quesion]: Thank you for the cooking analogy, clarifying the adaptation process faced by\nindividuals such as Ian Waterman. My next question is how technology has helped those\nwith somatosensory disorders? Please illustrate an example or analogy connected with\nmy art background to help me better understand how technology has been beneficial in\nthis area.\nA3\n[Answer]: Imagine a pianist, performing a complex piece of music, with some piano\nkeys either out of tune or triggering sharp pain. This pianist represents individuals with\nsomatosensory disorders constantly interpreting various types of sensations. Technology,\nlike sensory substitution, is equivalent to a piano tuner restoring the harmony of the keys\nor even substituting problematic ones. By transforming one sensory input into another, it\nassists the affected individuals in better navigation of their environment, granting them\na higher quality of life and restored harmony\u2014similar to ensuring that the challenging\nmasterpiece is played in a rewarding and fulfilling manner.\nQ4\n[Quesion]: The restoration example was informative and connected well with my un-\nderstanding. Now, based on my art experience, are there any artistic tools, practices, or\nskills that could potentially assist in body awareness and somatosensory perception? How\nwould they be applied in this context?\nQ4\n[Answer]: : I understand your interest in connecting artistic practices to body awareness\nand somatosensory perception. Let me present some ways in which the connection can be\nrefined and applied:\n1. Recognizing your artistic goals and preferences - this can guide your choice of\npractices; oriented towards tactile experiences or movement-based art forms, engaging\nmore effectively in enhancing somatosensory perception.\n2. Explore sensory-focused artistic works, such as performance art by Marina Abramovic\nor textile installations by Annica Cuppetelli, to understand their relationship to somatosen-\nsory perception.\n3. Delve into the various benefits of sensory-sensitive art engagement leading to im-\nproved movement coordination, therapeutic emotional effects, and deeper interpersonal\nconnections.\n4. To experience the tangible benefits firsthand, participate in workshops, observe pro-\nfessional demonstrations, or create artistic expressions involving painting, dancing, or\nsculpture to immerse yourself in somatosensory awareness.\n5. Acknowledge the interdisciplinary connections to physiology, neuroscience, or psychol-\nogy to deepen your understanding and personal connection with art\u2019s role in somatosen-\nsory perception.\nThough my perspective comes from art expertise, I hope that these connections and\nexamples present a comprehensive overview and inspire you to explore the integration of\nartistic practices with somatosensory perception further.\nPart\nQA Text\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Table 3: CONA DIWK Auto Guidance after RSP for presentation \u2019Lost of Touch Sensation Catald (2023)\u2019 with audience Painting Artist (Continued)</div>\nQ5\n[Quesion]: That was an insightful response. As my second-to-last question, can art\ntherapy play a role in helping individuals with somatosensory disorders? If so, how could\nvarious art practices contribute to enhancing their quality of life or resolving specific\nchallenges they might face?\nA5\n[Answer]: Art therapy can indeed benefit individuals with somatosensory disorders. Use\nof materials such as paint, clay, or fabric in creative activities encourages these individuals\nto explore and experiment with textures and tactile interactions, improving their sensitivity\nto different stimulations related to touch sensations.\nEngaging in artmaking can also improve body awareness by focusing on themes en-\ngaging movements\u2014drawing gesturally or sculpting a flexible human figure, for exam-\nple\u2014forming a stronger sense of physical spatial coordination and balance in relation to\nthe environment.\nAdditionally, creating art can foster emotional well-being and serve as a coping strategy\nagainst stress, anxiety, or other mental health challenges that might accompany somatosen-\nsory disorders. Engaging with art therapy thus supports both their physical rehabilitation\nprocess and mental resilience, ultimately enhancing their overall quality of life.\nQ6\n[Quesion]: For my final question, I\u2019d like to engage in a debate: Is restoring tactile\nfeedback through the use of somatosensory restoration technology ethical if it alters a\nperson\u2019s inherent way of experiencing the world? Just to be clear, I am for the use of\ntechnology in restoring somatosensory capabilities because it could significantly enhance\nan individual\u2019s quality of life. What are your thoughts on this matter?\nA6\n[Answer]: In advocating for somatosensory restoration technology, it is vital to de-\nvise a comprehensive framework, one which strikingly balances novel technological\nbenefits, and the advantageous attributes of alternative treatments. Prioritizing ethi-\ncal considerations, treatment approaches should incorporate concerns such as data pri-\nvacy, safety, and informed consent, ensuring a transparent and ethically-sound environ-\nment. Importantly, expanding insurance policies to encompass somatosensory restoration\ntechnology\u2014alongside rehabilitation services\u2014promotes accessibility and increases\ngovernmental/non-governmental support. A collaborative spirit between professionals\nin fields such as somatosensory restoration and rehabilitation specialists nurtures an\necosystem designed for optimal treatment outcomes. By simultaneously stimulating\nresearch in both technologies and alternative therapies, the evolving needs of patients\ncan be continually accommodated. Lastly, developing individualized treatment plans\nthrough an interdisciplinary and patient-centered approach elucidates considerations of\ncost-effectiveness, feasibility, and quality of life improvement on a case-by-case basis.\nPart\nQA Text\nA6 [Answer]: In advocating for somatosensory restoration technology, it is vital to devise a comprehensive framework, one which strikingly balances novel technological benefits, and the advantageous attributes of alternative treatments.

He fell ill with a severe case of what was believed to be gastric flu. After his initial symptoms subsided, he found himself unable to move or feel anything from the neck down. His muscles and joints were healthy, but it was as if a connection had been lost. It was later discovered that he had a rare and severe form of deafferentation, a neurological condition that interrupts the signals from the nervous system to the body. Deprived of his body\u2019s constant feedback on the position and movement of his limbs, Waterman found himself unable to do simple things like sit, stand, or walk. However, over time, he learnt to rely on his sight to judge the distance and position of his limbs, eventually regaining complete control over his body. This unexpected event sheds light on the importance of the somatosensory system. Like an orchestra, our somatosensory system brings together various receptors that play unique roles in creating a harmonious sensory symphony. This system regulates sensations arising from the surface and interior of our bodies, such as touch, pain, temperature, and our awareness of our bodies in space.\nThese sensations are processed by millions of tiny receptor cells embedded in our skin, muscles, tendons, and organs. Think of these receptor cells as artists in an art gallery, each with a unique talent. Mechanoreceptors sense mechanical deformation of the skin, thermoreceptors respond to temperature changes, while nociceptors, like vigilant guards, sense pain. Proprioceptors, on the other hand, sit deep in your muscles and tendons, continually detecting and relaying information about the position of your body. These receptors work by sending electrical signals to the brain through fibers they\u2019re attached to. For example, some nociceptors are attached to fibers with slightly more conductive, fatty myelin than others. Thus, when you get hurt, the electrical impulses from thicker nociceptors trigger sharp, intense pain, while thin, unmyelinated nociceptors are responsible for the dull, aching pain that follows. This system is like an art gallery\u2019s security system, with different alarms triggering different responses.\nIn the case of Ian Waterman, an autoimmune reaction attacked a large part of his nervous system, leaving him with no tactile or proprioceptive sensations from the neck down. But deafferentation is just one of the many somatosensory disorders. Damage to specific parts of the brain, skin or nerves can lead to the loss of certain sensations in particular locations. This can be likened to a pianist playing a complex piece of music, but with some piano keys either out of tune or causing pain. With the help of technology, like sensory substitution, harmony can be restored, allowing individuals to better navigate their environment. Artistic tools and practices can also assist in body awareness and somatosensory perception. Engaging in sensory-focused artistic works, exploring movement-based art forms, and participating in workshops or professional demonstrations can enhance somatosensory awareness. Furthermore, art therapy can benefit individuals with somatosensory disorders. Creative activities that encourage the exploration of textures and tactile interactions can improve their sensitivity to different stimulations related to touch sensations. Lastly, it\u2019s important to consider the ethics of using somatosensory restoration technology. While it can significantly enhance an individual\u2019s quality of life, it also alters their inherent way of experiencing the world. Developing a comprehensive framework that balances the benefits of this technology and alternative treatments is crucial. Prioritizing ethical considerations and ensuring a transparent and ethically-sound environment is a must. With the collaborative efforts of professionals in various fields, we can ensure the optimal treatment outcomes for individuals with somatosensory disorders.\nTable 4: CONA Synthetic Lecture Notes with original presentation \u2019Lost of Touch Sensation Cataldo (2023)\u2019 with audience Painting Artist and corresponding DIWK Auto Guidance after RSP (Continued)\nUltimately, it\u2019s evident that our somatosensory system, akin to a beautifully conducted orchestra, plays an essential role in how we experience and navigate the world. Like the artists in a gallery or musicians in an orchestra, the various receptors and cells within our bodies work in harmony to help us interpret and react to our surroundings. The unique experiences of individuals like Ian Waterman demonstrate the extraordinary adaptability of the human body and mind. Just as an art gallery continues to function with vigilant security systems, our bodies find ways to navigate around disruptions and maintain the harmony within. The integration of technology, like sensory substitution, is akin to a piano tuner, restoring and enhancing the symphony of our sensory experiences. Like a pianist navigating through a complex musical piece, individuals with somatosensory disorders use technology to improve their quality of life and navigate their environment better. Art practices, too, play a significant role in enhancing our somatosensory perception. Engaging in sensory-focused artistic works, exploring different textures and materials, and participating in movement-based art forms can all contribute to a better understanding and appreciation of our somatosensory system. In conclusion, the somatosensory system is a remarkable aspect of our physiology that deserves our attention and appreciation. Through a blend of scientific understanding, technological advances, and artistic exploration, we can continue to unravel the mysteries of this intricate system and improve the quality of life for those with somatosensory disorders.\n# A.3.2 Example 2\nThis is the support material for the Figure 5.\nTable 5: CONA DIWK Auto Guidance without RSP for presentation \u2019Tasmanian Devil Cancer Conroy (2023)\u2019 with audience AI Expert\nQ1\n[Quesion]: My first question relates to the two contagious facial cancers, DFT1 and DFT2.\nCan you provide an analogy to help me better understand the differences between these\ntwo cancers, considering my background in artificial intelligence?\nA1\n[Answer]: Certainly. Let us consider DFT1 and DFT2 as being akin to two different\nalgorithms designed to solve a specific problem. While both algorithms work toward\nachieving a common goal, they have distinct mechanisms meant to address the issue at\nhand. DFT1, which has been around longer, has a slower mutation rate like a traditional\nalgorithm with less chance for variation. In contrast, DFT2, identified more recently, has a\nfaster mutation rate comparable to using a modern, adaptable machine learning algorithm\nwith more opportunities for optimization. In this analogy, the problem represents tumor\ngrowth, while the algorithms represent the devils\u2019 contagious facial cancers.\nQ2\n[Quesion]: Thank you for the explanation. Your analogy has helped me understand the\ndifferences between DFT1 and DFT2 better. As for my second question, what factors\ncontributed to these particular cancers becoming contagious in Tasmanian devils, unlike\nmost cancers that do not spread between individuals?\nPart\nQA Text\nContinued on next page\nQ2\n[Answer]: You\u2019re welcome, and I\u2019m glad the analogy was helpful. As for the contagious\nnature of these cancers in Tasmanian devils, think of it as a unique vulnerability in their\nsystem, akin to a specific security breach in a network. For most species, including\nhumans, the body\u2019s immune system can recognize and eliminate foreign cancer cells.\nHowever, in the case of Tasmanian devils, their immune system is unable to detect these\ncancer cells as foreign due to the limited genetic diversity within the devil population.\nThe contagious cancers, specifically DFT1 and DFT2, exploit this vulnerability and are\ntransmitted through biting, a common behavior among devils, leading to rapid spread\namong the population.\nQ3\n[Quesion]: I appreciate your clarification on the contagious nature of these cancers in\nTasmanian devils. For my third question, how have these cancers (DFT1 and DFT2)\nevolved over time, especifically in terms of increased transmissibility or effectiveness?\nA3\n[Answer]: I\u2019m glad my answers have been helpful. Regarding the evolution of DFT1 and\nDFT2, you can envision it as similar to software updates, enhancing their functionality\nover time. When DFT1 initially emerged, it went through a \"superspreader\" event that led\nto six major DFT1 variants. These adaptations allowed the cancer cells to have improved\ntransmission and survival capabilities. Meanwhile, DFT2, though genetically similar to\nDFT1, has a substantially faster mutation rate. Its rapid evolution could be likened to\nan accelerated, advanced software system refining at an expedited pace. This increased\nmutation capability may provide DFT2 a competitive edge and allow it to spread more\neffectively. However, researchers are yet to determine if these mutations convey a specific\nselective advantage.\nQ4\n[Quesion]: Thank you for further detailing the evolution of DFT1 and DFT2. My fourth\nquestion is, what possible applications or considerations might there be for creating a\nmedical intervention for these cancers in Tasmanian devils, such as vaccines or treatments\nbased on these recent findings?\nQ4\n[Answer]: Certainly. Drawing from the artificial intelligence domain, the ultimate goal is\noften optimization or finding the best solution for a problem. In this context, these recent\nfindings about DFT1 and DFT2 help us understand the genetic vulnerabilities, origin,\nand evolutionary patterns of these cancers. This knowledge offers a robust dataset that\ncan influence the development of informed, targeted medical interventions for Tasmanian\ndevils.\nScientists can use this information to devise specific strategies, such as engineering vac-\ncines or treatments that counteract the fast mutation rate of these cancers or appropriately\nmodify the peculiar immune system loopholes in devils. The key is leveraging the in-\nsights gleaned from genomic analysis in a manner similar to developing custom plugins\nor patches in AI to address the anomalies driving DFT1 and DFT2 tumor growth and\ntransmission more effectively.\nQ5\n[Quesion]: As someone working in the field of artificial intelligence, my fifth question is\nconnected to my area of expertise. Can large-scale genomic sequence data and machine-\nlearning algorithms be employed together to make better predictions or advance our\nunderstanding of these transmissible cancers in Tasmanian devils and potentially reveal\nnew treatment methods?\nPart\nQA Text\nA5\n[Answer]: Absolutely! Large-scale genomic sequence data and machine learning algo-\nrithms can have synergistic effects in analyzing and understanding these transmissible\ncancers. To put it in context, consider genomic sequences as immense databases and\nmachine learning algorithms as highly specialized data mining tools.\nMachine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns, discover correlations,\nand possibly identify novel tumor characteristics from the genomic data, similar to detect-\ning useful features within vast datasets in the AI realm. Furthermore, these algorithms may\nhelp uncover hidden links between genes or genetic mutations and cancer progression,\nimproving our understanding of these diseases while potentially revealing novel targets\nfor therapeutics or helping create personalized medical interventions.\nIn essence, the combination of genomic data and machine learning algorithms forms a\npowerful resource to advance the investigation of transmissible cancers in Tasmanian\ndevils and guide treatment development.\nQ6\n[Quesion]: Thank you for demonstrating the potential benefits of utilizing large-scale\ngenomic sequence data and machine learning algorithms in the study of transmissible\ncancers. For my second-to-last question, how might I use the intricate modeling tech-\nniques in AI or machine learning to better grasp the possible futures of Tasmanian devil\npopulations or contain DFT1 and DFT2 by predicting their spread and evolution?\nA6\n[Answer]: In the context of AI and machine learning, you can leverage intricate modeling\ntechniques to better understand the potential futures of Tasmanian devil populations and\naddress the spread of DFT1 and DFT2. Utilize the empirical genomic data on these\ncancers, their mutation and transmission patterns, and variables such as devil populations,\ngeographic data, and environmental factors as inputs to construct sophisticated predictive\nmodels.\nThese models would help forecast how DFT1 and DFT2 could evolve, spread, and\ninteract with the host population, similar to running complex simulations in AI using\ndiverse datasets to analyze plausible outcomes. Actively adapting machine learning\nalgorithms could identify high-risk areas, transmission hot-spots, or anticipate population\nvulnerabilities.\nArmed with such predictive insights, conservationists, and domain experts can undertake\npre-emptive measures, design targeted interventions, and efficiently optimize strategies\nto prevent the aggressive spread of these cancers and ultimately conserve and protect\nTasmanian devils from possible population collapse.\nQ7\n[Quesion]: Thank you for demonstrating the potential benefits of utilizing large-scale\ngenomic sequence data and machine learning algorithms in the study of transmissible\ncancers.

However, based on the information you presented, I will attempt to create an\nanalogy to the best of my ability.\nConsider two strains of a computer virus, Virus1 and Virus2. Despite originating sepa-\nrately, they are similar in purpose - to spread and infect more systems. Virus1 spreads\nthroughout most of an interconnected network and has multiple variations due to years of\nexistence. On the other hand, Virus2 begins later and is primarily confined to one part\nof the network, but mutates much faster. Understanding the origins, development, and\npossible future shifts in these viruses can help us mitigate their consequences and protect\nour computer networks better.\nThis is my first version of the analogy. Please provide your feedback, and I will make\nadjustments accordingly.\nS1\n[Suggestion]: 1. Maintain relatability: Choose an understandable scenario, like a computer\nvirus or a disease. 2.

Malware1 emerged quite some time ago and\nhas since spread through a massive network, generating multiple variants along the way\ndue to its many transmissions. Conversely, Malware2 arose more recently and primarily\ninvades a smaller section of the network, but mutates at an accelerated rate. Similar to\nthe Tasmanian devil facial tumors, the two malware strains emerged separately, causing\nsignificant disturbances to their hosts, and evolved over time through spreading and\nmutating via transmission. By studying the origins, evolutionary paths, and propagation\ntrends of Malware1 and Malware2, experts can better decipher potential future dangers\nand secure computer networks against such attacks.\nThis is my modified version of the analogy, which integrates the provided suggestions.\nPlease let me know if there are additional changes to be made.\nS2\n[Suggestion]: 1. Clarify the similarities and differences between Malware1 and Malware2,\nparallel to the characteristics of DFT1 and DFT2. 2. Emphasize the impact of the malware\nstrains\u2019 emergence and evolution on their host networks, analogous to the Tasmanian\ndevil population. 3.

Highlight the importance of research to\npredict future consequences and trends for both the computer networks and Tasmanian\ndevil populations.\nA3\n[Final Answer]: Imagine two strains of malware impacting computer networks, Malware1\nand Malware2, each with separate origins and distinct characteristics. Malware1 emerged\nearlier and rapidly spread across a vast network, birthing numerous variants. Malware2\nsurfaced more recently and focused on a smaller network section, marked by its accel-\nerated mutation rate. The emergence and evolution of these malware strains negatively\naffect the host networks, just as DFT1 and DFT2 have inflicted the Tasmanian devil\npopulation. Studying both the malicious origin and their evolutionary paths can aid in\nunderstanding mechanisms underpinning their spread and mutations, ultimately contribut-\ning to developing protective strategies for conserving and treating host networks and the\nTasmanian devil population.

This information can help inform strategies for prevention or containment. In a\nmore general sense, AI and machine learning are already in use in cancer research by\nidentifying genetic mutations responsible for the disease, prognosis prediction, analyzing\ntreatment effects, etc. These applications could potentially extend to transmissible cancers\nin Tasmanian devils.\nChallenges regarding the use of AI and machine learning for these specific transmissible\ncancers may include the rarity of the disease and limited resources for study. However,\ninterdisciplinary collaboration between AI experts, cancer biologists, and geneticists has\nbeen valuable in addressing other complex scientific problems, leading to innovative\ntreatment methods and prevention strategies.\nIn the future, AI research areas, such as reinforcement learning, deep learning, or natural\nlanguage processing, might be used to better understand and tackle Tasmanian devil\ntransmissible cancers. However, expertise from biologists, geneticists, and experts specifi-\ncally studying these cancers would be crucial for assessing the applicability of artificial\nintelligence techniques in this context.\nS2\n[Suggestion]: 1.
