Research background and importance\n\nThe rapid development of e-commerce has made\npersonalized recommendation systems an important means to improve user experience and increase sales. However,\ntraditional recommendation algorithms have certain limitations when dealing with large-scale, multi-dimensional data, and it is difficult to accurately capture users' deep needs and interests, resulting in insufficient accuracy and diversity of\nrecommendation effects [1]. The capabilities of advanced graph attention networks in efficiently classifying complex data structures within heterogeneous information networks [2] highlight the potential of large language models to effectively process multidimensional data in e-commerce. In recent years, with the rise of large language models (LLMs), the field of natural language processing has made significant progress. LLMs have begun to attract widespread attention from academia and industry due to their outstanding performance in language understanding and generation, and have gradually been applied to personalized recommendation systems [3].\nLLMs have powerful semantic understanding and\n\nPersonal use of this material is permitted.

They can reveal users' potential\ninterests and needs by processing and analyzing a large amount of natural language text generated by users, thereby\nsignificantly improving the performance of recommendation systems. For example, by using LLMs to conduct in-depth analysis of user text input, users' multi-level needs can be better captured and more accurate recommendation results can be generated [4]. In addition, LLMs can effectively utilize external knowledge to make up for the shortcomings of traditional recommendation systems in data sparsity and cold start problems, thereby providing more personalized and flexible recommendation services [5]. Using LLMs to improve the effectiveness of personalized recommendation systems not only helps to improve the accuracy and diversity of\nrecommendations, but also provides a new technical approach to address the challenges faced by traditional recommendation algorithms. With the continuous deepening of the application of LLMs in recommendation systems, their importance and potential value are becoming more and more significant [6].\n\n# B. Research Objectives\n\nThis study aims to explore how to use large language\nmodels (LLMs) to improve the effectiveness of personalized recommendations in e-commerce. First, this paper analyzes the current development status of existing personalized\nrecommendation technologies and LLMs through a systematic literature review, and discusses in detail the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods. Secondly, this paper designs a recommendation system architecture based on LLMs, focusing on how to use the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to improve the performance of\nrecommendation systems in capturing users' multi-level needs. Finally, this paper verifies the designed recommendation system architecture through data collection, model training and experimental analysis, aiming to explore its effectiveness in improving recommendation accuracy and diversity. The\nultimate goal of this study is to provide a new methodological support for personalized recommendation systems in ecommerce and to provide a useful reference for further exploration of LLMs in practical applications.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">II. L ITERATURE R EVIEW\n</div>\n# II. L ITERATURE R EVIEW\n\nA. Current Status and Development of Personalized\nRecommendation Technology in E-commerce\n\nPersonalized recommendation technology in e-commerce\nhas made significant progress in recent years. With the rapid growth of the number of goods and users on e-commerce platforms, traditional recommendation systems, such as\ncollaborative filtering, content filtering, and rule-based\n\nrecommendation, have gradually faced performance\nbottlenecks, especially in terms of data sparsity and\nrecommendation accuracy [7]. In order to meet these\nchallenges, researchers have begun to explore more complex and intelligent recommendation algorithms, such as\nrecommendation systems based on deep learning and big data analysis. These new recommendation systems can better handle large-scale data and perform well in terms of\nrecommendation accuracy and real-time performance [8]. The introduction of machine learning technology has also greatly enhanced the capabilities of personalized recommendation systems. By leveraging users' historical behavior data and product attribute information, these systems can generate more accurate recommendation results. For example, hybrid\nrecommendation systems that combine offline data mining and online real-time recommendation are widely used in modern ecommerce platforms to improve the system's response speed and recommendation effect [9]. In addition, with the\ndevelopment of big data technology, personalized\nrecommendation systems can provide more customized\nrecommendation services by deeply analyzing user behavior [10]. However, despite many advances, existing personalized recommendation systems still face some challenges, such as data privacy issues, insufficient diversity of recommendation results, and algorithm interpret ability. Solving these problems will be an important direction for future research and the key to improving e-commerce personalized recommendation\ntechnology [11].\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have made significant\nprogress in the field of natural language processing in recent years, especially in language understanding and generation tasks. LLMs can learn rich semantic information by pretraining on large-scale text data and show strong adaptability in a variety of downstream tasks [12]. The scale and complexity of these models continue to increase with the improvement of computing power, so that they can handle more complex language tasks. At the application level, LLMs have been widely used in many fields such as dialogue systems, text generation, and machine translation. For example, models such as ChatGPT perform well in tasks such as generating natural dialogues, writing code, and providing real-time translation services, significantly improving the naturalness and efficiency of user interactions. In addition, LLMs have found applications in areas such as financial research, transportation flow prediction, healthcare, and creative tasks like lyric generation, further showcasing their versatility across different domains [13] [14] [15] [16]. LLMs are also used in the field of education to help students improve their learning outcomes by automatically generating learning content and providing\npersonalized teaching suggestions [17]. However, the\ndevelopment of LLM is also accompanied by some challenges, such as huge consumption of computing resources, data bias and ethical issues. Solving these problems requires further research and technological innovation to ensure that the widespread application of LLM will not bring negative effects [18].\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/afdd/afdd4c27-f003-4794-871a-f18f5f29e761.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 1. Application of LLM in e-commerce platform recommendation system\n</div>\nFig. 1 shows the workflow of the recommendation system\nof an e-commerce platform [19]. When a customer visits a website, the system first checks whether the user is logged in. For logged-in users, the system calls a personalized\nrecommendation model based on a large language model (LLM), filters relevant data from the database, loads the recommendation model, and generates personalized\nrecommended products. This process utilizes the deep semantic understanding capabilities of LLM to provide more accurate recommendations by analyzing the user's historical behavior and contextual information. For users who are not logged in, the system displays all products or popular products, and allows users to evaluate products after logging in. These evaluations will be saved and used to optimize future recommendation results.\n\nC. Current research status of LLM application in\npersonalized recommendation\n\nAs the application of large language models in natural\nlanguage processing gradually matures, researchers have begun to explore its potential in personalized recommendation systems. LLM's advantages in understanding and generating natural language text make its application in personalized recommendation possible. By combining user-generated text data with product attribute data, LLM can better capture user interests and needs, thereby improving the accuracy and diversity of recommendations [3]. At present, some studies have attempted to combine LLM with traditional\nrecommendation algorithms to form a hybrid recommendation system to enhance the recommendation effect. For example, some studies use LLM to generate user portraits to more accurately identify users' long-term interests and short-term needs, which shows obvious advantages in cold start problems [20]. In addition, LLM's ability to process multimodal data (such as text, images, videos, etc.) enables it to play a wider role in recommendation systems, such as generating\npersonalized content recommendations or interactive\nrecommendation experiences [21]. Although LLM has broad application prospects in personalized recommendation, there are still many problems to be solved, such as how to effectively integrate LLM with existing recommendation algorithms and how to reduce the impact of data bias on recommendation results. Solving these problems will help improve the overall\n\nperformance of personalized recommendation systems and further promote the application of LLM in recommendation systems [3].\n\normance of personalized recommendation systems and her promote the application of LLM in recommendation ems [3].\n\n# III.

The experimental results clearly show that the recommendation model based on LLM outperforms traditional recommendation algorithms in multiple key indicators, such as precision, recall, and recommendation diversity. This\nimprovement is not only due to LLM's deep understanding of natural language, but also its ability to process subtle semantics in user comments and product descriptions, thereby more accurately grasping the real needs of users. In addition, LLM shows high flexibility and robustness in adapting to different user scenarios, and can dynamically adjust the\nrecommendation strategy according to the user's context, making the recommendation results more relevant and\npersonalized.\nOverall, this study provides a new idea for personalized\nrecommendation. By combining the advantages of traditional recommendation algorithms with the semantic processing capabilities of LLM, we not only improve the accuracy of recommendations, but also greatly increase the diversity of recommended content. The application of this method can not only improve the user experience, but also significantly improve the sales and user stickiness of e-commerce platforms.\nIn future work, the integration of deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) techniques could be explored to further enhance the adaptability of personalized recommendation systems. DRL's ability to optimize decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments [22] could complement the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. By incorporating DRL, future systems may become more responsive to changing user preferences and behaviors, offering a more dynamic, personalized, and context-aware experience. Additionally, adversarial learning techniques could be investigated to strengthen the robustness of recommendation systems. Zhu et al. [23] demonstrated the effectiveness of adversarial strategies in optimizing sequential recommendations within multi-latent spaces, which could help address challenges related to evolving user interests and data sparsity. By combining DRL and adversarial learning, future systems may better navigate complex user behavior patterns and provide more resilient and adaptive recommendations.\n\n[1] L. Wu, Z. Zheng, Z.
