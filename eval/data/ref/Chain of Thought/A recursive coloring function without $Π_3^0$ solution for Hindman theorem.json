Introduction\nReverse mathematics is an area of mathematical logic trying to find the strength of theorems: which axioms are needed to prove these theorems. Among all axiom systems, reverse mathematics mainly focuses on five subsystems of second-order arithmetic, known as the Big Five:\nThis paper will mention ACA0, which is equivalent to say that the Turing jump exists for every set of natural numbers. One of the most important topics in reverse mathematics is the Ramsey\u2019s theorem and its variants. The reverse mathematics version of Ramsey\u2019s theorem can be seen as an infinite version of Ramsey\u2019s theorem in combinatorics. This theorem states that, for any coloring (of finite many colors) function c on [N]n, there exists an infinite set that is homogeneous. This infinite set is called a solution to c. The strategy of analyzing these theorems is to study the computational complexity of their solutions. Jockusch [5] proved that the strength of Ramsey\u2019s theorem (for n \u22653) is exactly ACA0 by examining the complexity of the solutions: every recursive coloring has a \u03a00 2 solution and therefore ACA0 is sufficient to prove Ramsey\u2019s theorem; and there exists a coloring such that any solution to it can compute its Turing jump, which shows ACA0 is also necessary. In this paper, we discuss about the reverse mathematics about Hindman\u2019s theorem. Hindman\u2019s theorem is a Ramsey-type combinatorics theorem about finite sums:\nTheorem 1.1 (Hindman, 1974[4]). For any coloring function c : N \u2192r, where r \u22652 is a natural number, there exists an infinite set H \u2282N such that FS(H) is monochromatic under c where FS(H) is the set consisting of all finite sums of\ndifferent numbers from H:\n\ufffd For convenience, we call such a set H in the above theorem a solution to c for Hindman\u2019s theorem. In this paper, Hindman\u2019s theorem is abbreviated as HT. The study of reverse mathematics of Hindman\u2019s theorem began with the paper by Blass, Hirst, and Simpson in 1987 [1]. They established some basic results about complexity of solutions of Hindman\u2019s theorem: Theorem 1.2 (Blass, Hirst, and Simpson 1987[1]). 1. For any coloring function c : N \u2192r , there exists a solution to c for Hindman\u2019s theorem that is recursive in c(\u03c9+1), the (\u03c9 + 1)-th Turing jump of c. 2. There exists a recursive coloring function c such that any solution to c can compute c\u2032; this result can be relativized to any degree. Based on these results about the complexity of solutions, they showed that the strength of Hindman\u2019s theorem is between ACA0 and ACA+ 0 : ACA0 is necessary and ACA+ 0 is sufficient. Simply speaking, ACA+ 0 is to say the \u03c9-th Turing jump of every set exists. However, this result has not been improved since 1987. In addition, before presenting their main results, Blass, Hirst, and Simpson provided another theorem as an example, which gives a lower bound on the complexity of a solution for Hindman\u2019s theorem. That is:\nWe may call Theorem 1.3 the \u22060 2-unsolvability of Hindman\u2019s theorem. In the paper [7], Towsner gave a simplified proof of Hindman theorem using the techniques of half-match and full-match of a coloring function. Towsner showed that every recursive coloring function has a full-match which is an arithmetic set and hence a solution of \u2205(\u03c9+1) degree. Moreover, if every recursive coloring has a full-match which is a recursive set, then every recursive coloring will have an arithmetic solution for Hindman\u2019s theorem and ACA0 will be the exact strength of Hindman\u2019s theorem. In the same paper, Towsner also discussed about the improvement of Theorem 1.3. In this paper, we will prove the \u03a00 3-unsolvability of Hindman\u2019s theorem: Theorem 1.4. There exists a recursive coloring function c in finitely many colors without any \u03a00 3 solutions for Hindman\u2019s theorem. Another topic of Hindman\u2019s theorem is the restricted version of Hindman\u2019s theorem. The most common restricted Hindman theorem\u2019s is the following theorem HT\u2264k r : Theorem 1.5 (restricted Hindman\u2019s theorem HT\u2264k r for fixed numbers r, k). For any coloring function c : N \u2192r and any natural number k, there exists an infinite set H \u2282N such that FS\u2264k(H) is monochromatic under c. Here, FS\u2264k(H) is defined as following: FS\u2264k(H) = \ufffd\ufffd x\u2208F x : F \u2282H, |F| \u2264k is and nonempty \ufffd .\nThere are plenty of results about the restricted Hindman theorems HT\u2264k r , see [3] and [2]. However, even for such weak theorems, we do not know much about their strength. For example, we do not know if ACA0 can prove any such restricted Hindman\u2019s theorem, even for HT\u22642 2 . In this paper, we will not focus on the numbers of colors r and will consider the following restricted version written as HT\u2264k:\nTheorem 1.6 (restricted Hindman\u2019s theorem HT\u2264k for a fixed number k). For any coloring function c : N \u2192r, where r \u22652 is a natural number , there exists an infinite set H \u2282N such that FS\u2264k(H) is monochromatic.\nIn Section 2, we will prove the \u22060 3-unsolvability for HT. In Section 3, we will prove the \u03a03 0-unsolvability for HT with weak apartness (defined in Section 2). In section 4, we will prove the \u22060 3-unsolvability for HT\u22643 and \u03a00 3-unsolvability for HT without weak apartness.\n# 2. Proof of \u22060 3 unsolvability\nIn this section, we will construct a coloring function c in two colors which is not a solution to any infinite \u22060 3 set. First, we list some notations. Some of them are from Blass, Hirst, and Simpson\u2019s paper[1] and Hindman\u2019s paper[4].\nDefinition 2.1. 1. Define two functions \u00b5(x), \u03bb(x) on Z+ as follows: For x = \ufffdk i=0 2ni \u2208Z+ where n0 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk, define \u00b5(x) = nk, \u03bb(x) = n0. 2. For two positive integers x < y, we write that x \u226ay or y \u226bx if \u00b5(x) < \u03bb(y). A set A has apartness (or is with apartness) if for any x < y in A, x \u226ay. 3. For each natural number n, define the set Bn = {x \u2208Z+ : \u00b5(x) = n} and B\u2264n = {x \u2208Z+ : \u00b5(x) \u2264n}. 4. A set A has weak apartness if for any natural number m, Bm \u2229A contains at most one element and for any natural number l, there are at most two numbers x such that \u03bb(x) = l. Hence if a set A has weak apartness, then for any natural number L, there exists M such that for any x > M in A, \u03bb(x) > L.\nFor convenience, for a set A, we use A(x) to denote its characteristic function. We say that a coloring c or a construction of coloring kills a set A, or a set A is killed, if FS(A) is or will not be monochromatic (under c). And in this paper, any quantifier without specified range is over the set of natural numbers N, and the same for intervals. For example, \u2200x\u03c6 means that for any x \u2208N, \u03c6 holds and n \u2208(a, b), n \u2208(a, b], n \u2208[a, b) means that n is an integer between a and b, not a real number. And for all limit notations such as limx f(x) or lim x f(x), it means: lim x\u2192\u221ef(x). A number x \u226bY for a set T means for any y \u2208Y , x \u226by.\nStrategy. A naive strategy is to set infinitely many requests \u27e8x, y\u27e9\u2208N2 and each such request means that let x be the Red and y be Green. But this strategy does not succeed. Instead, we try another kind of request. A request \u27e8w, x\u27e9means that let w + x and w be different colors. We must limit the number of requests we set. For example, if we set requests \u27e84, 2\u27e9, \u27e84, 3\u27e9, and \u27e86, 1\u27e9, then because 4 + 2 = 6, 4 + 3 = 7, 6 + 1 = 7, all three numbers 4, 6, 7 need to have different colors, which contradicts the condition that c has only two colors.\nLemma 2.3. Let R be a function from a recursive subset of N2 to N such that R(n, w) \u2208Bn. There exists a coloring function c : N \u2192{0, 1} uniformly recursive in R such that for any w and n < \u03bb(w), if R(n, w) is defined, then\nProof. Because the domain of R(n, w) is recursive, we extend R to whole N2. We construct the coloring function c stage by stage. At stage s, we color numbers in Bs. For each s, we will create a graph with vertex set Bs and edges depending on the function R such that this graph is a tree. So for any w1, w2 \u2208Bs, there exists a unique path P from w1 to w2. Fix a stage s. For each w \u2208Bs and n < \u03bb(w), We add one edge between w + R(n, w) and w and call it ew,w+R(n,w). This graph does not contain any multiple edges or self-loops. We show that this graph is a tree by induction. For every w \u2208Bs and n < \u03bb(w), define the vertex set Tw,n = {w + x : 0 \u2264x < 2n+1} and consider the corresponding induced subgraph. By definition, Tw1,n1 = Tw2,n2 iff (w1, n1) = (w2, n2). If we write integers in binary representation, then the vertex set Tw,n looks like\nwhere wsws\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 wn+1 is the highest s \u2212n many digits of w and it is also the common part of all numbers in the vertex set Tw,n. All other digits of w are 0. And by definition, for n \u22651,\nHence the induced subgraph of Tw,n is the union of the induced subgraphs of Tw,n\u22121, Tw+2n,n\u22121 and the edges between vertices in Tw,n\u22121 and vertices in Tw+2n,n\u22121. We claim that there exists exactly one edge between two vertex sets Tw,n\u22121, Tw+2n,n\u22121.\nAssume there exists an edge e\u2032 from w\u2032 \u2208Tw,n\u22121 to w\u2032 + R(n\u2032, w\u2032) \u2208Tw+2n,n\u22121. Because by definition \u00b5(R(n\u2032, w\u2032)) = n\u2032 < \u03bb(w\u2032), if n\u2032 < n then w\u2032 + R(n\u2032, w\u2032) is still in Tw,n\u22121 and if n\u2032 > n, then w\u2032 + R(n\u2032, w\u2032) is greater than all numbers in Tw+2n,n\u22121. Hence n\u2032 = n. Again, because n = n\u2032 < \u03bb(w\u2032), w\u2032 = w otherwise w\u2032 is not in Tw,n\u22121. Hence such edge is unique and the claim is true. Now we show that all induced graphs of Tn,w are trees by induction on n. For n = 0 and every w that \u03bb(w) > 0, Tw,0 has a single vertex. For n > 0, by induction hypothesis, for any w that \u03bb(w) > n, Tw,n is a tree because it is the union of two trees (induced graphs of Tw,n\u22121 and Tw+2n,n\u22121) plus one edge between two trees. Since Bs = T2s,s\u22121, the graph of Bs is a tree. Definition of the coloring: Let c(2s) = 0. For another vertex w, because the graph is a tree, find the unique path P from 2s to w and let c(w) be the length of P modulo 2. This definition is uniformly recursive in R. Verification: Let Pw be a path from 2s to w and x = R(n, w). If w + x is a vertex in Pw, then it must be the vertex in Pw exactly before w: otherwise there will be two paths from w to w + x. So c(w + x) \u2261|Pw| \u22121 mod 2 \u0338= c(w). If w + x is not in the path, then the path Pw plus ew,w+x is a path from 2s to w + x, and c(w+x) \u2261|Pw|+1 mod 2 \u0338= c(w). In both cases, c(w) \u0338= c(w+x), and this coloring satisfy the requirement of the lemma. \u25a1\nOnce we have Lemma 2.3, our task becomes to construct a function R satisfying the second condition C2. The construction will use approximations of \u22060 3 sets. By recursion theory [6], a set A is \u22060 3 iff A \u2264T \u2205\u2032\u2032 and A \u2264T B\u2032 iff there exists a function \u02dcA(x, k) \u2264T B such that limk \u02dcA(x, k) = A. More precisely, we will use the following lemma. Lemma 2.4. There exists a recursive list of total recursive functions {Ai(x, k, s)}i\u2208N valued in {0, 1} such that for any \u22060 3 set A and its characteristic function A(x), there exists a function Ai(x, k, s) in the list such that for any x,\nProof. If a set A is \u22060 3, then A \u2264T \u2205\u2032\u2032 and hence there exists a function \u02dcA(x, k) \u2264T \u2205\u2032 such that limk \u02dcA(x, k) = A(x). Let \u02dcA(x, k) = \u03a6\u2205\u2032 i (x, k), where \u03a6i is the i th recursive function with oracle. Consider \u03a6\u2205\u2032[s] i (x, k)[s] and we will show that for every x, limk lims \u03a6\u2205\u2032[s] i (x, k)[s] exists and equals A(x) . By definition, there exists k0 such that for any k > k0, \u02dcA(x, k) \u2193= A(x). Now for a number k > k0, we check if lims \u03a6\u2205\u2032[s] i (x, k)[s] = \u02dcA(x, k). Because \u02dcA(x, k) = \u03a6\u2205\u2032 i (x, k) is defined, there exists s such that \u03a6\u2205\u2032[s](x, k)[s] \u2193= \u02dcA(x, k) and the usage of \u2205\u2032 in the computation will never be changed since stage s. Now we could see for any s\u2032 > s, this computation still holds and \u03a6\u2205\u2032[s\u2032](x, k)[s\u2032] = \u02dcA(x, k). So lims \u03a6\u2205\u2032[s](x, k)[s] = \u02dcA(x, k). Hence limk lims \u03a6\u2205\u2032[s] i (x, k)[s] = A(x) . So we define the list as follows. For each natural number j, define Aj(x, k, s) = \u03a6\u2205\u2032[s] j (x, k)[s] if it is 0 or 1, and Aj(x, k, s) = 0 otherwise. This is a total recursive function and this list is also recursive. \u25a1\nStrategy of killing one set. Assuming A is an infinite \u22060 3 set with weak apartness, we show how to kill A by constructing the function R. If for this R, condition\n\u25a1\nC2 holds, then, by Lemma 2.3, we can construct a coloring function c that kills the set A. Our strategy is to guess which number is in A \u2229Bn (by weak apartness, A \u2229Bn contains at most one element) and let R(n, w) be this element. We can use its approximation A(x, k, s) as a guess function. We use the guess function to construct the function R(n, w). For numbers n, w, compute A(x, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) for all x \u2208Bn, and check if there exists any x in Bn such that\nwhich suggests that x \u2208Bn \u2229A; if such x exists, then we guess Bn \u2229A \u0338= \u2205and let R(n, w) be the minimal one among all such x; if such x does not exist, le R(n, w) = 2n+1 \u22121, i.e.:\nWe show that this construction can kill set A. Because A is infinite, there exists n such that Bn \u2229A is nonempty. Let x be the unique element in Bn \u2229A. By Lemma 2.4, for any number y in Bn, limk lims A(y, k, s) = A(y). Because Bn is finite, limk lims(A(\u00b7, k, s) \u2191Bn) = A(\u00b7) \u2191Bn. Therefore, for sufficiently large k, s, for any y \u2208Bn \\ {x}, A(y, k, s) = 0 and A(x, k, s) = 1. Now, look for a number K such that for any k > K, lims(A(\u00b7, k, s) \u2191Bn) = A(\u00b7) \u2191Bn and choose a number w1 \u2208A such that \u03bb(w1) > K and n; let k = \u03bb(w1). Next, for the fixed number k, look for a number sk such that for any s > sk, A(\u00b7, k, s) \u2191Bn = A(\u00b7) \u2191Bn and choose another number w2 \u226bw1 from A such that \u00b5(w2) > sk. Let w = w1 + w2, then \u03bb(w) = \u03bb(w1) = k > K and \u00b5(w) = \u00b5(w2) > sk. Combining all discussions above, A(\u00b7, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) \u2191Bn = A(\u00b7) \u2191Bn. This means A(x, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) = 1 while for any y \u2208Bn \\ {x}, A(y, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) = 0. By the definition of function R(n, w), R(n, w1 + w2) = x \u2208A. All three numbers x \u226a w1 \u226aw2 are in A. By Lemma 2.3, there exists a recursive function c such that c(w1 + w2) \u0338= c(x + w1 + w2) where both w1 + w2 and x + w1 + w2 are in FS(A). Kill infinitely many sets. The strategy of killing infinitely many sets is based on the strategy of killing a single set. Now, condition C2, as defined earlier, becomes:\nWe show that this construction can kill set A. Because A is infinite, there exists n such that Bn \u2229A is nonempty. Let x be the unique element in Bn \u2229A. By Lemma 2.4, for any number y in Bn, limk lims A(y, k, s) = A(y). Because Bn is finite, limk lims(A(\u00b7, k, s) \u2191Bn) = A(\u00b7) \u2191Bn. Therefore, for sufficiently large k, s, for any y \u2208Bn \\ {x}, A(y, k, s) = 0 and A(x, k, s) = 1. Now, look for a number K such that for any k > K, lims(A(\u00b7, k, s) \u2191Bn) = A(\u00b7) \u2191Bn and choose a number w1 \u2208A such that \u03bb(w1) > K and n; let k = \u03bb(w1). Next, for the fixed number k, look for a number sk such that for any s > sk, A(\u00b7, k, s) \u2191Bn = A(\u00b7) \u2191Bn and choose another number w2 \u226bw1 from A such that \u00b5(w2) > sk. Let w = w1 + w2, then \u03bb(w) = \u03bb(w1) = k > K and \u00b5(w) = \u00b5(w2) > sk. Combining all discussions above, A(\u00b7, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) \u2191Bn = A(\u00b7) \u2191Bn. This means A(x, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) = 1 while for any y \u2208Bn \\ {x}, A(y, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) = 0. By the definition of function R(n, w), R(n, w1 + w2) = x \u2208A. All three numbers x \u226a w1 \u226aw2 are in A. By Lemma 2.3, there exists a recursive function c such that c(w1 + w2) \u0338= c(x + w1 + w2) where both w1 + w2 and x + w1 + w2 are in FS(A). Kill infinitely many sets. The strategy of killing infinitely many sets is based on the strategy of killing a single set. Now, condition C2, as defined earlier, becomes: for any \u22060 3 infinite set Ai with weak apartness, there exist numbers w \u2208FS(Ai) and n < \u03bb(w) such that R(n, w) \u2208Ai. We will continue to use the construction of previous section with one more step: first of all, we need to choose a set Ai among all \u22060 3 sets by some priority arguments, and then apply that construction. To do this, we first guess which Ai have nonempty intersection with Bn, and then choose one such set among them. This argument needs the second guessing function guessing that: for a number n and a set Ai, whether Ai \u2229Bn is empty or not. For a set Ai, a number w, and a number n < \u03bb(w), we check if there exists x \u2208Bn such that Ai(x, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) = 1 and use a function ai(n, k, s) to denote this check:\nBecause Bn = {x : \u00b5(x) = n} is finite, this function is also recursive and tot If ai(n, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) = 1, which means that such x \u2208Bn that Ai(x, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) = exists, then we guess Ai \u2229Bn is nonempty; otherwise, we guess Ai \u2229Bn is emp\nWe cannot recursively list all infinite \u22060 3 sets, but by Proposition 2.4, we have a recursive list of some total recursive functions Ai(x, k, s) such that every \u22060 3 set is represented in the list. This list contains approximations of all infinite \u22060 3 sets. However, some functions in the list may not correspond to an infinite \u22060 3 set, a set with weak apartness or even a set. So we need to use some restrictions similar to Blass, Hirst and Simpson\u2019s paper. During the construction, for any function Ai(x, k, s) and any pair k, s, we will choose at most 2i many numbers n \u2208(i, s) and call them the candidates of Ai for k, s. For any k, s, any set Ai has at most 2i many candidates. When defining R(n, w), only if n is a candidate of Ai for k = \u03bb(w), s = \u00b5(w), Ai may be chosen to apply the construction of killing one set. Construction. We use the recursive list {Ai(x, k, s)}i\u2208N in Proposition 2.4. First, for each Ai(x, k, s) in the list, define ai(n, k, s) = max{Ai(x, k, s) : x \u2208Bn} as mentioned before. Next, for each k, s define a candidate set Ci(k, s) to be the set of first 2i numbers n \u2208(i, s) such that ai(n, k, s) = 1. If there are not 2i many such number n, then simply let Ci(k, s) be all such n. These sets Ci(k, s) are uniformly recursive in i, k, s. Third, for each n, w, compute the set {i < n : n \u2208Ci(\u03bb(w), \u00b5(w))}, the index set of sets Ai that Ci(\u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) contains n, which means that we guess Ai \u2229Bn \u0338= \u2205. Finally, let j = min({i < n : n \u2208Ci(\u03bb(w), \u00b5(w))} \u222a{n})) and\nas killing one set in previous subsection. This is the construction of the function R(n, w). R(n, w) is a recursive function. By Lemma 2.3, we can construct a coloring function c recursively in R(n, w) and that coloring function c satisfies the condition C1: for any w and n < \u03bb(w), c(w) \u0338= c(w + R(n, w)). The only remaining task is verifying condition C2 for R(n, w) and c. Verification. In this subsection, we show that the above construction satisfies condition C2. By Proposition 2.4, every \u22060 3 set is contained in the list, we only need to consider sets in the list. We use Ai to denote the set represented by Ai(x, k, s) if that set is defined. First, we have the following lemma. Lemma 2.5. Let Ci(k, s) be the function in our construction. For any infinite \u22060 3 set Ai with weak apartness, there exists a finite set Ci of size 2i such that limk lims Ci(k, s) \u2193= Ci. Proof. Because Ai is infinite and has weak apartness, there are infinitely many n > i such that Ai \u2229Bn is nonempty. Let N be the 2i th number n among them. By definition, for any x in B\u2264N, limk lims Ai(x, k, s) = Ai(x). Because B\u2264N is finite, by properties of limits, we also have:\nHence for any sufficiently large k, there exists sk such that for any s > sk and every n \u2264N, ai(n, k, s) = max{Ai(x, k, s) : x \u2208Bn} = max{A(x) : x \u2208Bn}. This means, for n \u2264N, ai(n, k, s) = 1 iff Bn \u2229Ai is nonempty . Because N is the 2ith number n > i such that Bn \u2229Ai is nonempty, there exists 2i numbers n \u2264N greater than i such that Bn \u2229Ai is nonempty and hence ai(n, k, s) = 1. By\ndefinition, Ci(k, s) is the set of first 2i elements n \u2208(i, s) such that ai(n, k, s) = 1; hence for those sufficiently large k, s, Ci(k, s) is equal to the set of first 2i number n > i that Bn \u2229Ai \u0338= \u2205. So we can conclude that, for any sufficiently large k, there exists sk such that for any s > sk, Ci(k, s) exactly contains first 2i number n > i such that Bn \u2229Ai \u0338= \u2205. This is just limk lims Ci(k, s) \u2193= Ci for a fixed set Ci. \u25a1\n\ufffd \ufffd Proof. Consider limits limk lims Ci(k, s) \u2193= Ci and limk lims Ai(\u00b7, k, s) \u2191B\u2264N = Ai(\u00b7) \u2191B\u2264N in the proof of Lemma 2.5 and let Xi = \u222an\u2208CiBn \u2229Ai. Using these two limits, there exists a number K such that for any k > K, there exists a number sk such that for any s > sk, Ci(k, s) \u2193= Ci and Ai(\u00b7, k, s) \u2191B\u2264N = Ai(\u00b7) \u2191B\u2264N. We show that if these two equations hold for numbers k, s, then for any w such that k = \u03bb(w), s = \u00b5(w), there exists x \u2208Xi such that R(\u00b5(x), w) = x and hence this lemma is true. We claim that for these k, s, for at least one n \u2208Ci(k, s) = Ci,\nBecause for k, s, Ai(x, k, s) = Ai(x) for all x \u2208Bn, min{x \u2208Bn : Ai(x, k, s) = 1} is defined and is just the unique element in Bn \u2229Ai. Hence R(n, w) is the unique element in Bn \u2229Ai and is in Xi. So for these k, s that Ci(k, s) \u2193= Ci and Ai(\u00b7, k, s) \u2191B\u2264N = Ai(\u00b7) \u2191B\u2264N, for any w such that \u03bb(w) = k, \u00b5(w) = s, there exists x \u2208Xi such that R(\u00b5(x), w) = x. This finishes the proof. \u25a1\n\u25a1\nTheorem 2.7 shows that there exists a recursive coloring function c such that for any infinite \u22060 3 set A with weak apartness, FS\u22643(A) is not monochromatic. This theorem is close to our aim. We can use the following fact proved by Hindman: Lemma 2.8 ([4]). For any infinite set A, there exists an infinite set B \u2264T A such that B has apartness and FS(B) \u2286FS(A). So for the same coloring function c, if it has any infinite \u22060 3 set A as a solution, then it can compute an infinite solution B with apartness. Since A is \u22060 3 and B \u2264T A, B is also \u22060 3. However, Theorem 2.7 implies that this is impossible. Now we have proved our aim of this section as follows: Theorem 2.9. There exists a recursive coloring function c without any \u22060 3 solution for Hindman\u2019s theorem.\nGeneral Preparation. To prove \u03a03 case, we will use more functions similar to R(n, w), denoted as R, Q. And we need a lemma generalizing Lemma 2.3. Lemma 3.1. Let R(n, w) be a function with recursive domain such that R(n, w) \u2208 Bn, and r > 1. There exists a coloring function c : N \u2192r uniformly recursive in R such that for any w and any n < \u03bb(w), if R(n, w) is defined, then:\nProof. This proof is very similar to the proof of Lemma 2.3. First, we extend the domain of R to whole N2. For each number s, we create a graph with vertex set Bs as in Lemma 2.3. As shown in Lemma 2.3, this graph is a tree, meaning that there exists a unique path from one vertex to another. Definition of the coloring: Let c(2s) = 0. For another vertex w, because the graph is a tree, find the unique path P from 2s to w. An edge ew\u2032,w\u2032+R(n\u2032,w\u2032) in the path is considered a positive edge if the direction from w\u2032 to w\u2032 + R(n\u2032, w\u2032) is the same as the direction from 2s to w; otherwise it is considered a negative edge. Then we count the number of positive edges, a and the numbers of negative edges, b and let the color of P be a \u2212b mod r. This process is uniformly recursive in R. Verification: similar to Lemma 2.3, let Pw be the unique path from 2s to w, and let x = R(n, w). If w +x is a vertex in Pw, then it must be the vertex in Pw exactly before w; and because the direction of edge ew,w+x is from w to w + x, Pw is Pw+x adding a negative direction edge. So c(w) \u2261c(x + w) \u22121 mod r. If w + x is not in the path, then the path Pw adding ew,w+x is a path from 2s to w + x; because the direction of edge ew,w+x is from w to w + x, Pw+x is Pw adding a positive direction edge. So c(w) + 1 \u2261c(x + w) mod r. \u25a1 We will use two special forms of this lemma. The first special form is when r = 2, it returns to Lemma 2.3. The second special form is when the function R(n, w) only depends on \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w) in addition to n: for example, the function in the last section, R(n, w) = min({x \u2208Bn : A(x, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) = 1} \u222a{2n+1 \u22121}).\nWe can see, for w1 \u0338= w2, if \u03bb(w1) = \u03bb(w2) and \u00b5(w1) = \u00b5(w2), then R(n, w1) = R(n, w2). In this case, we write this kind of functions in a form of three variables like R(n, k, s), Q(n, k, s).\nCorollary 1. Let Q be a function from a recursive subset of N3 to N such that Q(n, k, s) \u2208Bn and r > 1, there exists a coloring function c : N \u2192r uniformly recursive in Q such that for any w and n < \u03bb(w), if Q(n, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w)) is defined,\nc(w + Q(n, \u03bb(w), \u00b5(w))) \u2261c(w) + 1 mod r.\nSimilar to last section, we need to choose a list approximation of \u03a00 3 sets. By definition, every \u03a00 3 set A can be represented as x \u2208A \u2194\u2200y\u03a6(x, y) by a \u03a30 2 formula \u03a6(x, y). By recursion theory [6], there exists a total recursive function g(i, x, y) such that if \u03a6i(x, y) is the ith \u03a30 2 formula, then \u03a6i(x, y) holds iff Wg(i,x,y) is finite, which is also equivalent to that lims |Wg(i,x,y),s| is finite. So we consider a function\nthe max value of sizes of Wg(i,x,y\u2032) at stage s for all y\u2032 \u2264y. If x \u2208A, then because for any y, Wg(i,x,y) is finite, F(i, x, y, s) \u2264maxy\u2032\u2264y |Wg(i,x,y\u2032),s| and hence lims F(i, x, y, s) exists and is finite; if x /\u2208A, then there exists y0 such that |Wg(i,x,y0)| = \u221eand lims |Wg(i,x,y0),s| = \u221e, and so for any y \u2265y0, lims F(i, x, y, s) = \u221e. We conclude this by the following lemma:\nLemma 3.2. There exists a total recursive function F(i, x, y, s) such that: 1.The function F(i, x, y, s) is non-decreasing with respect to y and s separately. Therefore for any i, x and y, the limit lims F(i, x, y, s) exists and this limit is nondecreasing with respect to y. 2. For each i, let Ai = {x : \u2200y lims F(i, x, y, s) is finite}. Then Ai is a \u03a00 3 set. 3. For any \u03a00 3 set A, there exists i such that A = Ai where Ai is defined in 2. Therefore, the function F(i, x, y, s) defines a list \u27e8Ai\u27e9i\u2208N of \u03a00 3 sets that includes all \u03a00 3 sets.\nStrategy. As in the case of \u22060 3, to define the recursive coloring function c, we will construct a recursive function R(n, w) and apply Lemma 3.1. Similar to \u22060 3 case, the function R(n, w) must satisfy the condition that, for any infinite \u03a00 3 set Ai with weak apartness, there exists w \u2208FS(Ai) and n \u226aw such that R(n, w) \u2208Ai. Constructing such a function R(n, w) is the key part of the strategy. During the construction in the \u22060 3 case, for each n, we guess and choose a correct set Ai by a priority argument such that Ai \u2229Bn \u0338= \u2205. We then try to construct a function R(n, w) such that for sufficiently many w, R(n, w) is an element in Ai. In \u03a00 3 case, we will use new strategy. During the construction, for a fixed n, we guess and choose a specific set Ai by a priority argument such that Ai \u2229Bn \u0338= \u2205, and aim to make it so that the value of R(n, w) can be any number in Bn when w goes through the set FS(Ai). If so, there exists a number w \u2208FS(Ai) such that R(n, w) \u2208Ai. In other words, for a fixed n, we can regard R(n, \u00b7) as a coloring function from w \u2208N to one of |Bn| many colors, a number R(n, w) \u2208Bn. Then our aim is to let FS(Ai) includes all colors under the coloring function R(n, \u00b7). We can use Corollary 1 to do this. For each fixed n, to construct such a function R(n, \u00b7), we construct a recursive function Qn(y, k, s) : N3 \u2192N such that Qn(y, k, s) \u2208By and later we will apply Corollary 1 for Qn(y, k, s) and r = |Bn| to get a function R(n, \u00b7). The construction\nof Qn(y, k, s) depends on the choice of the set Ai. If we choose a set Ai, then our aim is ensure that for most sufficiently large y, k, s, Qn(y, k, s) is in Ai. In this way, we can find enough sufficiently large w\u2032 \u2208Ai such that w\u2032 = Qn(y\u2032, k\u2032, s\u2032) for some y\u2032, k\u2032, s\u2032. And later we are able to find an arbitrarily long sequence of such w\u2032: w1 \u226aw2 \u226a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u226awk \u226awk+1 \u226a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u226awL all in Ai and (because of Corollary 1) for any 1 \u2264k < L\n\u25a1\nwhich is the set {i < n : B(i, n, y, s) < k} minus {i < n : \u2203m < n, I(m, y, k, s) = i We claim that\n(3.1)\nlim y lim k lim s {i < n : \u2203m < n, I(m, y, k, s) = i} = H(n)\nTo prove equation (3.1), we begin with the definition of Z(n) and B(i, n, y, s). By properties of finite operations of limits, there exists y1 such that for any y > y1 and any k, there exists s\u2032 y,k such that for any s > s\u2032 k,y and any i \u2208n \\ Z(n), B(i, n, y, s) > k. Similarly, for any y there exists k\u2032\u2032 y such that for any s and any i \u2208Z(n), B(i, n, y, s) < k\u2032\u2032 y. Hence:\nEquation (3.1) is true. We will now prove equation (3.2). By the Induction Hypothesis, for any m < n, I(m) is defined. Using properties of finite operation of limits, we can find y0 such that for any y > y0, there exists ky such that any k > ky, there exists sy,k such that for any s > sy,k and any m < n, I(m, y, k, s) = I(m). Thus, we have {i < n : \u2203m < n, I(m, y, k, s) = i} = {i < n : \u2203m < n, I(m) = i}.\nThe right-hand side of this equation is equal to H(n). Therefore, we conclude that limy limk lims{i < n : \u2203m < n, I(m, y, k, s) = i} = H(n). Since equations (3.1)(3.2) hold, by properties of finite operations of limit,\n3  Proof. We prove this lemma by induction on i. For each i, if Ai is infinite, there exist infinitely many n such that Ai \u2229Bn \u0338= \u2205. For any j < i, if Aj is finite, there exists nj such that for any n > nj, Aj \u2229Bn = \u2205; and by induction hypothesis, for any j < i, if Aj is infinite, there exists nj such that I(m) = j. So we choose a number N sufficiently large such that Ai \u2229BN is nonempty and for any j < i, either Aj \u2229BN = \u2205or \u2203m < N, I(m) = j. If there exists n < N such that I(n) = i, the we are done. Otherwise by the definition of H(N), we have i /\u2208H(N); since Bn \u2229Ai \u0338= \u2205, we have i \u2208Z(N). Therefore i \u2208Z(N) \\ H(N). For any j < i, if Aj \u2229BN = \u2205, then j /\u2208Z(N); if \u2203m < N, I(m) = j then j \u2208H(N). Thus for any j < i, we have j /\u2208Z(N) \\ H(N). Therefore i = min(Z(N) \\ H(N) \u222a{\u221e}) and by Lemma 3.6, I(N) = i. Therefore, there exists n \u2264N such that I(n) = i. \u25a1\nand \u03bb(x1) > Y . We need to find xr+1 such that lims Q(\u00b5(xr), \u03bb(xr+1), s) = xr. Since B\u00b5(xr) \u2229Ai is nonempty, limk lims Qn(\u00b5(xr), k, s) = xr; therefore we only need to choose xr+1 such that \u03bb(xr+1) is sufficiently large. Choose a sufficiently large xr+1 \u226bxr in Ai such that lims Qn(\u00b5(xr), \u03bb(xr+1), s) = xr. Now the sequence x1 \u226ax2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u226axr+1 satisfies the lemma. \u25a1 Lemma 3.8. Let Ai be an infinite \u03a00 3 set with weak apartness, n be a natural number such that I(n) = i and R(n, w) be the function constructed. For any r > 1, there exist r different numbers wj, j < r in FS(Ai) such that: (1) for any wj, \u03bb(wj) > n; (2) for any two different wj1 and wj2, R(n, wj1) \u0338= R(n, wj2). Proof. By Lemma 3.7, there exists a sequence \u27e8xg\u27e90<g\u2264r such that, \u2200g \u2208(0, r), lim s Q(\u00b5(xg), \u03bb(xg+1), s) = xg. Choose a sufficiently large xr+1 \u2208Ai such that xr+1 \u226bxr and \u2200g \u2208(0, r), Q(\u00b5(xg), \u03bb(xg+1), \u00b5(xr+1)) = xg.\nFor h \u2208(0, r], let wh = \ufffdr+1 g=h xg. We show that for 0 < h2 < h1 \u2264r, R(n, wh1) \u0338= R(n, wh2). For each wh, \u00b5(wh) = \u00b5(xr+1) and \u03bb(wh) = \u03bb(xh). So by Lemma 3.7 and our assumption, Qn(\u00b5(xh), \u03bb(wh+1), \u00b5(wh+1)) = xh. Then by the construction and Corollary 1:\nSo R0(n, wh1) \u2261R0(n, wh2) \u2212(h1 \u2212h2) mod r and each wh has distinct R(n, wh) value. \u25a1 Lemma 3.9. Let Ai be an infinite set with weak apartness and R(n, w) be our function, there exists n, x \u2208Bn \u2229Ai and w \u2208FS(Ai) that \u03bb(w) > n, such that:\nLemma 3.9. Let Ai be an infinite set with weak apartness and R(n, w) be our function, there exists n, x \u2208Bn \u2229Ai and w \u2208FS(Ai) that \u03bb(w) > n, such that:\nProof. By Lemma 3.6, there exists n such that I(n) = i and by Lemma 3.8, for r = |Bn|, there exist numbers wi, i < r all in FS(Ai) such that \u03bb(wi) > n and each wi has a distinct R(n, wi) value. Because R(n, wi) \u2208Bn for any such wi, for any x \u2208Bn, there exists one wi among them such that R(n, wi) = x. By Lemma 3.5, i = I(n) = min{Z(n) \\ H(n) \u222a{\u221e}}. Because i is a number rather than \u221e, i \u2208Z(n) = {i < n : Ai \u2229Bn \u0338= \u2205}. Hence Ai \u2229Bn \u0338= \u2205. Therefore we can choose x \u2208Bn \u2229Ai and wi such that R(n, wi) = x and these n, wi, x are what we need. \u25a1\nTheorem 3.10. There exists a recursive coloring function c : N \u21922 such that for any infinite \u03a00 3 set Ai with weak apartness, there exists w1, w2 \u2208FS(Ai) such that c(w1) \u0338= c(w2).\nProof. Use the function R(n, w) in our construction and apply Corollary 1 for R(n, w) to get a coloring function c. We show that c is what we need. For any infinite \u03a00 3 set Ai with weak apartness, by Lemma 3.9, there exists numbers n, x, w such that x \u2208Bn \u2229Ai, \u03bb(w) > n, w \u2208FS(Ai) and R(n, w) = x. By the Corollary 1, c(w) \u0338= c(w + R(n, w)) if n < \u03bb(w). So c(w) \u0338= c(w + x).\n\u25a1\nBecause \u03bb(w) > n = \u00b5(x), both w and w +x are in FS(Ai). Two numbers w, w +x are both in FS(Ai) and c(w) \u0338= c(w + x). This is what we want to show. \u25a1\nIn this section, we will prove \u22060 3 unsolvability for HT\u22643 without weak apartness and \u03a00 3 unsolvability without weak apartness.\nLemma 4.1. There exists a recursive coloring function c0 : N \u2192{0, 1}2 such that for any infinite set A, if it does not have weak apartness, then it is not a solution to c for HT\u22642.\nProof. We define two coloring functions c1, c2 : N \u2192{0, 1}:\nWe show that for c0 = c1 \u00d7 c2, if an infinite set A has not weak apartness, then it is not monochromatic under c0. If A has not weak apartness, there are two cases. The first case is that, there are two numbers x1, x2 such that \u00b5(x1) = \u00b5(x2) = m. This means these two numbers are in the interval [2m, 2m+1). Thus \u00b5(x1 + x2) = m + 1, and c1(x1) \u0338= c1(x1 + x2). Therefore, A is not monochromatic. The second case is that, there are three number x1, x2, x3 such that \u03bb(x1) = \u03bb(x2) = \u03bb(x3) = l. In this case, all three numbers are divisible by 2l and not by 2l+1. So for any X among these three numbers, X \u22612l or 2l+1 + 2l mod 2l+2 and there must be two number X1, X2 among x1, x2, x3 such that X1 \u2261X2 mod 2l+2. Hence X1 + X2 is divisible by 2l+1 but not 2l+2 and \u03bb(X1 + X2) = l + 1. Since \u03bb(x1) = l, c2(X1 + X2) \u0338= c2(x1) and A is not monochromatic. In each cases, A is not monochromatic. Therefore, if A does not have weak apartness, then it is not monochromatic under c0 = c1 \u00d7 c2. \u25a1 Using Lemma 4.1, we can prove our theorems. Theorem 4.2. There exists a recursive coloring function c : N \u2192{0, 1}3 such that any infinite \u22060 3 set A is not a solution to c for HT\u22643. Proof. By Theorem 2.7, there exists a recursive coloring c1 : N \u2192{0, 1} such that any infinite \u22060 3 set with weak apartness is not a solution for HT\u22643. Let c = c1 \u00d7 c0 where c0 is the coloring in Lemma 4.1 and we claim that this coloring is what we need. For any infinite \u22060 3 set A, if it has weak apartness, then it is not a solution to c1 for HT\u22643; if it does not have weak apartness, then it is not a solution to c0 for HT\u22642 (hence HT\u22643). In each case, A is not a solution to c = c1 \u00d7 c0 for HT\u22643. \u25a1 Theorem 4.3. There exists a recursive coloring function c : N \u2192{0, 1}3 such that, any infinite \u03a00 3 set A is not a solution to c for HT. Proof. By Theorem 3.10, there exists a recursive coloring c2 : N \u2192{0, 1} such that any infinite \u03a00 3 set with weak apartness is not a solution to c2 for HT. Let c = c2 \u00d7 c0 where c0 is the coloring in Lemma 4.1 and we claim that this coloring is what we want. For any infinite \u03a00 3 set A, if it has weak apartness, then it is not a solution to c2 for HT; if it does not have weak apartness, then it is not a solution to c0 for HT\u22642 (hence HT). So in either case, A is not a solution to c = c \u00d7 c for HT. \u25a1\nWe show that for c0 = c1 \u00d7 c2, if an infinite set A has not weak apartness, then it is not monochromatic under c0. If A has not weak apartness, there are two cases. The first case is that, there are two numbers x1, x2 such that \u00b5(x1) = \u00b5(x2) = m. This means these two numbers are in the interval [2m, 2m+1). Thus \u00b5(x1 + x2) = m + 1, and c1(x1) \u0338= c1(x1 + x2). Therefore, A is not monochromatic. The second case is that, there are three number x1, x2, x3 such that \u03bb(x1) = \u03bb(x2) = \u03bb(x3) = l. In this case, all three numbers are divisible by 2l and not by 2l+1. So for any X among these three numbers, X \u22612l or 2l+1 + 2l mod 2l+2 and there must be two number X1, X2 among x1, x2, x3 such that X1 \u2261X2 mod 2l+2. Hence X1 + X2 is divisible by 2l+1 but not 2l+2 and \u03bb(X1 + X2) = l + 1. Since \u03bb(x1) = l, c2(X1 + X2) \u0338= c2(x1) and A is not monochromatic. In each cases, A is not monochromatic. Therefore, if A does not have weak apartness, then it is not monochromatic under c0 = c1 \u00d7 c2. \u25a1\nHere we list some open questions related to our topic. The first question is to prove the \u22060 4 case: Question 1: Is there any recursive coloring without any \u22060 4 solution for Hindman\u2019s theorem? Similarly, in our paper we prove the \u22060 3-unsolvability of not only Hindman\u2019s theorem, but HT\u22643. However, we have not been able to prove the same theorem for the \u03a00 3 case so far. Therefore, we pose the following question: Question 2: Is there any recursive coloring such that any infinite \u03a00 3 sets is not a solution for HT\u22643? Another similar question is about the number of colors although. In this paper we do not focus on this, it is still worth to consider: Question 3: Is there any recursive 2-coloring such that any infinite \u22060 3 sets is not a solution for HT\u22643 and is there any recursive 2-coloring such that any infinite \u03a00 3 sets is not a solution for Hindman\u2019s theorm? Of course, the aim of this type of questions is to find an example without any arithmetic solution. However, there is currently no mainstream consensus on whether the Hindman\u2019s theorem can be proven within ACA0. It is also possible that every coloring has an arithmetic or even \u22060 4 solution. This belongs to the opposite side of reverse math of Hindman\u2019s theorem, the upper bound of a solution.\n# References\nEmail address: liao yuke@u.nus.edu\n",
