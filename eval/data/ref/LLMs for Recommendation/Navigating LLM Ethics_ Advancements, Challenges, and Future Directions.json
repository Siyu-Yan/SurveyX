Introduction\nDevelopment of language models based on artificial intelligence (AI) resulted in dramatic advancements in human-computer interaction, and the nature of information dissemination and communication went through a remarkable transformation. At the forefront of these models are LLMs, with their astounding capabilities in generating texts and decoding languages across diverse domains. However, with their remarkable power comes a critical responsibility\u2014a responsibility underscored by necessary ethical considerations that accompany their development and deployment.    \n   The power of words holds immense responsibility, especially where the impact can directly  influence individuals, families, and communities. Authors bear the weight of accountability for the  spoken and written words they craft, understanding the potential repercussions they may have on  those affected. In an era where technology burgeons, LLMs driven by artificial intelligence have  emerged as potent tools for generating text, for example content relevant to health research and  information and disinformation dissemination. These LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Jasper, Surfer, and  others, wield the potential to transform the way information is conveyed and shared. However,  with this transformative capability comes a heightened need for accountability and ethical  consideration, as acknowledged by developers who concede the propensity for inaccuracy within  AI-generated content.[1]    This paper explores the multifaceted landscape of ethical dilemmas surrounding LLMs. We  embark on a journey through the intricacies of these AI-driven language models, dissecting ethical  quandaries that arise in their operations, shedding light on their impact on society, and presenting  prospective pathways to navigate the complex ethical web they weave. Our exploration begins  with an elucidation of the convergence between Conventional Language Models (CLMs) and Pretrained Language Models (PLMs), delving into their fundamental differences in training, causality  constraints, and token representation. This comparison sets the stage for understanding the ethical  considerations interwoven within the architectures of these models. Furthermore, we scrutinize the  inherent biases ingrained within LLMs, dissecting their origins and their impact on AI decisionmaking. Our account also encompasses complex ethical aspects, acknowledging the  interdisciplinary nature of addressing ethical concerns in LLMs. Additionally, as we grapple with  the challenges of opacity within LLMs, we advocate for dynamic audit tools tailored to these  models, emphasizing continuous monitoring, explainability techniques, and adaptable frameworks  capable of navigating the ever-evolving landscape of AI-driven language models.    In this study, our pursuit is twofold: firstly, to illuminate the pressing challenges that demand  immediate attention, and secondly, to present strategies for their mitigation and ethical  enhancement, paving the way for responsible development and deployment of LLMs in society.

Understanding Large Language Models \nLanguage models (LMs) are essential tools within the scope of natural language processing (NLP) for understanding and predicting probability distributions within sequences of linguistic units, such as words or phrases. Their primary function is to anticipate the likelihood of tokens (textual units, often broken down into sub-word units) occurring within a given text sequence. These models, particularly the generative ones, function in an autoregressive manner, predicting the probability distribution of a token based on its preceding tokens. The predictive mechanism of LMs involves using the chain rule of probability and conditional probabilities to estimate this joint probability: \n# P(u1, u2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ut) = P(u1)P(u2|u1)P(u3|u1, u2)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 P(ut|u1, ...ut\u22121),\nwherein 'u' symbolizes a sequence comprising T tokens, and P(u1) signifies the probability of the first unite u1, P (u2 | u1) signifies the probability of the u2 given u1, representing the probability of u2 occurring after u1, and so on up to ut.[2]  \nA LLM significantly augments the size of an LM, incorporating a large number of model  parameters, typically ranging from tens of millions to billions [3]. These models have exhibited  some unexpected abilities and emerging skills. [4] [5]  To enhance its proficiency, an LLM  undergoes extensive training using large volumes of diverse data. This augmented size and  extensive training enable LLMs to grasp intricate linguistic patterns, thereby improving their  ability to generate more coherent and contextually appropriate text. The methodological  foundation of LLMs involves leveraging immense computational power coupled with  sophisticated algorithms to process and analyze colossal amounts of textual data. This enables  these models to acquire a deep understanding of language structures and semantics, thereby  generating a text that closely resembles human-written content. \nA LLM significantly augments the size of an LM, incorporating a large number of model  parameters, typically ranging from tens of millions to billions [3].

These models expedite breakthroughs in industries like  healthcare, education, and finance by facilitating language translation, text summarization,  conversational AI, and content generation. These models can be utilized in information retrieval,  sentiment analysis, and personalized content recommendation. Further, their transformative\ncapabilities are evident in their potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. With the progress of these models, their use in diverse applications has profound implications for reshaping the landscape of human-computer interfaces and the broader technological paradigm.[6][7] \n# 2.2.Ethical Theories and Approaches \nThere are various ethical considerations surrounding LLMs, involving various moral frameworks such as Utilitarianism, Deontology, Virtue Ethics, and more. [8], [9] These frameworks and related theories can lay the ethical grounds for developing, implementing, and using LLMs. Utilitarianism accounts for morality in terms of maximizing utility or societal welfare. A utilitarian view of LLMs would underscore their overall benefit versus their harmful consequences. However, a deontological view of these models would emphasize conformity to moral rules and duties, recommending ethical guidelines to govern their use. A virtue ethical or character-based approach would prescribe LLM developers and users to cultivate moral virtues to ensure ethical decisionmaking.    Application of these ethical theories to LLMs requires meticulous contemplation. Utilitarian principles may urge optimizing LLMs for societal good while mitigating potential harms, Deontological perspectives necessitate respecting privacy, autonomy, and fairness in data collection and use, and Virtue Ethics may encourage fostering virtues like transparency, accountability, and responsibility in the design and deployment of these models. The comparative analysis of these ethical theories unveils their strengths and weaknesses concerning LLMs. While Utilitarianism offers a broad perspective, it may overlook individual rights and risks. Deontology, whereas it gives prominence to ethical principles, it is not flexible enough to be easily adapted to technological developments. Finally, Virtue Ethics, despite its focus on character development, fails to offer tangible guidelines for distinctive moral dilemmas associated with LLMs.    A multidimensional approach is required for embedding ethical concerns into LLM development, as it involves integrating ethical considerations throughout the design process, ensuring diversity representation in data collection, fostering transparency in model development, and implementing mechanisms for accountability and ongoing evaluation of the model\u2019s outcomes. Furthermore, it requires interdisciplinary collaborations where ethicists, technologists, policymakers, and stakeholders engage to establish comprehensive frameworks that align ethical principles with practical applications in the realm of large language models .[10] \n# III.  Methodology\nWe conducted an inclusive and systematic review of academic papers, reports, case studies, and frameworks regarding LLM ethics, written in English. Given that there is not a specific database\non LLM ethics in particular, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to develop a protocol in this review (Figure 1).  In order to conduct a comprehensive review of the relevant studies, we followed two approaches. First, we manually searched for the most related papers on LLM ethics: 17 papers were identified through online search after the removal of duplicate files. Secondly, we fulfilled a keyword-based search (using the Google Scholar search engine) to collect all relevant papers on the topic. This search was accomplished using the following keyword phrases: (1) \u201cethics + large language models\u201d which provided 14 relevant result pages of Google Scholar, (2) \u201cethics + large +language+ models\u201d for which the first six result pages were reviewed, and (3) \u201cLLM + ethics,\u201d for which the first nine result pages of Google Scholar were reviewed.  Moreover, the following keywords \u201ctransparency/ privacy/ fairness / bias /accountability/ mitigation / misinformation / hate speech / cyber-bullying / copyright / Censorship /auditing / limitations / Case studies + large language models/LLM\u201d were reviewed respectively in first 3/6/5/6/4/16/6/6/6/6/4/6/10 pages of google scholar and included because of their central role in the research as the major known (based on a preliminary review) ethical considerations of LLM. Additionally, the search was suspended within results for each search term due to limited  appearances of new relevant papers on the following pages. \nThe results of the search were 456 relevant papers (which were selected based on the semantical  keywords relevancy), out of 1147 (which appeared on the result pages). Afterward, the duplicated  papers were eliminated from the analysis. We selected the 192 target papers for this systematic  review based on the following two inclusion/exclusion criteria. First, articles that were published  in academic journals were included. Second, the dominant topic of the papers (or a significant part  of it) was LLM ethics. To this end, the papers\u2019 main sections were reviewed to understand their  dominant topic rather than only relying on the title and papers\u2019 keywords. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/7998/7998b449-4bc9-4d36-86ca-ba88bdf965d4.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n# IV.

Ethical Concerns in LLM \nLLMs  like ChatGPT and LLaMA give rise to various ethical concerns with significant implications for society [11]\u2013[14], including bias and fairness, privacy and data security, misinformation and disinformation, transparency and accountability, intellectual property and plagiarism, access and inequality [11]\u2013[19].  \n  Biases may exist in data with which LLMs have been trained. These may affect their functioning,  resulting in outputs that accentuate stereotypes or involve unjust discriminations against certain  groups, negatively affecting marginalized groups [11], [13]. Moreover, the data with which LLMs  are trained may contain personal, sensitive, or proprietary information, which raises worries about  privacy and data security, risking individual and public safety and compromising trust in digital  systems [11]. The misinformation and disinformation concerns are raised by the fact that LLMs  are capable of generating convincing but potentially false or misleading content. This can be used  to spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, or create fraudulent materials, which has  severe consequences for public health, democracy, social harmony [14], [17], [20], [21].  Transparency and accountability concerns result from the black-box nature of LLMs, which makes  it difficult to determine responsibility for harmful outputs or decisions [11]. The ability of LLMs  to generate texts that closely resemble human writing raises concerns about intellectual property  and plagiarism [12]. In addition, the benefits of LLMs might be unequally distributed, exacerbating  existing inequalities, raising concerns on access and inequality [11], [22].    Existing studies have explored these ethical concerns in LLM using surveys, experiments, and  reviews. [11] examines the ethical aspects of LLMs like ChatGPT, using established methods for  technology ethics analysis. It identifies benefits and challenges, including issues of social justice,  autonomy, safety, bias, accountability, and environmental impact. Moreover, the study highlights  the need for a broader approach to AI ethics, focusing on stakeholder engagement and holistic  policy interventions. [14] summarized the risks from LLMs into six areas and reviewed 21 risks \nin detail, covering discrimination, data security, misinformation, environment issues, and so on. [15] investigated the effects of biases on LLMs to understand the practical aspects of implementing LLMs. Some studies focused on the ethical concerns in specific scenarios. For example,  [12] analyzed ChatGPT's ability to offer advice on cheating in assessments by a series of 'conversations' held with multiple instances of the model. [20] explored the ability of current LLMs to blend advertisements with organic search results, indicating that their proficiency in merging ads with relevant topics is clear.     As discussed in literature, the ethical concerns in LLMs arise due to factors inherent in their design, training, and potential applications [11], [12], [14], [15], [20], [22][24].

As discussed in literature, the ethical concerns in LLMs arise due to factors inherent in their design, training, and potential applications [11], [12], [14], [15], [20], [22]\u2013[24]. Dealing with these concerns involves a multi-faceted approach that includes technical strategies (e.g., algorithms to detect and reduce biases), policy development (e.g., privacy protection regulation), ethical guidelines (e.g., respecting intellectual property), and stakeholder engagement (e.g., collaboration between industry, academia, and regulatory bodies).  \n# 4.2.  Ethical Frameworks and platforms in LLM \nThe ethical frameworks surrounding LLMs are multifaceted and crucial for their responsible deployment (See Table 3). In order to mitigate potential dangers and misconceptions, a humancentered evaluation framework for LLMs is proposed. This framework places emphasis on understanding users' mental models, assessing the utility of use cases, and addressing cognitive engagement in human-AI interaction.[25] \nTable 3: Ethical Frameworks and Platforms for LLMs \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/ba3b/ba3b673c-3dd3-4ca4-ab6a-6359cd8a6b82.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Given the need for new evaluation metrics, a shift from task-specific to user-centric measures is also proposed in employing LLMs. [26] Some scholars outlined seven trustworthiness categories</div>\nGiven the need for new evaluation metrics, a shift from task-specific to user-centric measures is  also proposed in employing LLMs. [26] Some scholars outlined seven trustworthiness categories \nand 29 sub-categories related to reliability, safety, fairness, explainability, adherence to norms,  and robustness. [27] Moreover, [28] provides a solid foundation for an ethical framework for  LLMs by invoking deontological ethics in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The paper highlights the application of this framework in question-answering systems and objectionable  content detection through four case studies, emphasizing the robustness of deontological ethics in safeguarding individuals' rights and duties. Regarding chatbots in healthcare, particularly in hardto-reach communities, some scholars propose a guide for evaluating and monitoring chatbot technology deployment, recommending the incorporation of medical ethics into AI regulatory  frameworks in order to enhance risk assessments and regulations.[29]    [30] underscores the importance of prioritizing human autonomy in AI systems, addressing  concerns about intentional misuse, unintentional harm caused by biases, and societal impacts. It  advocates for ethical decision-making in organizational settings and curated datasets to mitigate  harmful language model outputs. Some also critiques bottom-up approaches and proposes a topdown framework based on moral theories, demonstrating its effectiveness in guiding LLMs on  normative ethics and common-sense morality datasets. [31] Highlighting polarization in AI  debates, some scholars also argue for a systematic, interdisciplinary approach to managing the  risks associated with LLMs.They propose RegNLP as a multidisciplinary research space for identifying and measuring risks emerging from LLMs and NLP technology.[32]    In their examination of ethical considerations in detecting online abusive content, some scholars  raise concerns despite high accuracy. They proposes a two-step framework guided by the principle  of Ethics by Design, which categorizes and assesses abuse severity within content categories.[33] Discussing ethical outcomes in NLP system development, some scholars advocate for an \"Ethical  by Design\" approach, which promotes best practices such as proactive planning, default ethical  settings, embedded ethics, transparency, and respect for user value.[34], [35].     Discussing ethical frameworks in LLMs, some studies addresses methodological challenges in  developing morally informed AI systems, particularly in the case of recent models such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. It notes their reliance on fine-tuning with specific data and the need for a prescriptive foundation based on ethical theories.[36] \nDiscussing ethical frameworks in LLMs, some studies addresses methodological challenges in developing morally informed AI systems, particularly in the case of recent models such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa.

Different types of bias in LLM\nLanguage Large Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA can exhibit biases. These biases generally result from their training data and the algorithms used in their development. The biases in LLMs can be categorized into social biases, language biases, and representation biases.(See Table 4) \nSocial biases in LLMs have been extensively studied by scholars recently. Social biases reflect  model biases related to various aspects of social status and characteristics, such as gender, age,  income, race, occupation, education, and lifestyle choices [37]\u2013[50]. These biases are generated  due to the nature that LLMs can perpetuate biases in the training data, which reinforces stereotypes  and unequal performance in content generation related to different social groups. [45] conducted  an examination of gender biases in reference letters generated by LLMs, focusing on biases in  language style and lexical content. The results indicated substantial gender biases in the LLMgenerated recommendation letters. [41] employed ChatGPT and LLaMA to create news content,  using headlines from two newspapers recognized for their unbiased reporting. They assessed the  gender and racial biases in the content generated by these LLMs by comparing it with the original  news articles. The study found that the LLM-generated content displayed significant biases,  particularly showing discrimination against women and Black individuals.     Language biases refers to the preferential treatment or unequal performance of LLMs across  different languages, dialects, or linguistic styles. These biases can lead to unequal service quality  or information accuracy, reinforcing social inequalities in education, communication and business  [37], [44]. In addition, [37] found that biases regarding gender, race, age, religion, and social class  exist when the LLMs are used for translation tasks. \nLanguage biases refers to the preferential treatment or unequal performance of LLMs across different languages, dialects, or linguistic styles.

In addition, [37] found that biases regarding gender, race, age, religion, and social class exist when the LLMs are used for translation tasks. \nTable 4: Major identified biases in LLMS\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/1ce1/1ce12c23-f48f-45ed-b28d-4ff206b3e7f8.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/5250/5250331d-59cf-4c5a-a8ab-ca55853c38bb.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nRepresentation biases in LLMs occur when certain groups, perspectives, or types of information are underrepresented or misrepresented in the training data of these models, including demographic, cultural, and socioeconomic representations. The consequences of representation bias can reinforce stereotypes, perpetuating inequalities, and failing to serve diverse user groups effectively [40], [43], [44], [47].  \nRecent AI research has increasingly focused on the issue of fairness in LLMs, driven by an expanding recognition of their potential to perpetuate or even magnify existing biases. Research in this area primarily concentrates on assessing the fairness of LLMs and developing strategies to improve their fairness. [51]\u2013[59] \nMultiple scholars have proposed evaluation methods to assessing the fairness of LLMs. [53] introduced a new benchmark named FaiRLLM. This benchmark includes meticulously designed metrics and a dataset that considers eight sensitive attributes within two specific recommendation contexts: music and movies. Their evaluation of ChatGPT revealed that the model continues to show elements of unfairness in relation to some of these sensitive attributes. [52] examined ChatGPT's performance in high-stakes areas such as education, criminology, finance, and healthcare. They employed a detailed evaluation framework that accounted for both group and individual fairness and analyzed disparities in ChatGPT's responses to biased and unbiased prompts.  \nResearchers have been developing methods to improve the fairness in LLMs, focusing on improvements in both the model training process and the design of the prompts. [58] proposed an approach to make references to demographic groups unrelated to their portrayal in the text, thus reducing social bias. They also introduce a method to estimate this correlation's upper limit using importance sampling and a natural language corpus. Empirical tests on real-world benchmarks show that this method effectively improves fairness without compromising language modeling proficiency. [54] leverages a personalized prefix prompt and a prompt mixture designed to boost fairness in relation to various sensitive attributes. Their experiments with two real-world datasets reveal that the UP5 model demonstrates superior fairness compared with benchmark fairnessaware recommendation models. \n# 4.4.  Privacy and Data Security in LLM \nAcademic research on data security and privacy in LLMs reflects a growing recognition of the  critical need to safeguard sensitive information [60]\u2013[62]. Researchers are actively exploring  innovative techniques to mitigate privacy risks inherent in LLMs [63], [64], which often  process and generate vast amounts of data, including potentially sensitive user information.  Key areas of focus include developing privacy-preserving methods like differential privacy  [65], discriminator use [66], and matrix-vector functions [67]. These methods aim to protect  user data while maintaining the utility and accuracy of LLMs. Moreover, research is being  directed towards integrating these privacy-preserving techniques directly into the architecture  and training processes of LLMs, striving for a balance between advanced language processing  capabilities and rigorous data security standards [68], [69].  \n# Misinformation and Disinformation in LLM \nLLM misinformation and disinformation studies are a popular field, as these models become more  prevalent in generating and disseminating information. Scholars are concerned with how LLMs  can unintentionally propagate or amplify false information, given their capacity to generate  realistic and coherent text [70]. Key research areas include developing mechanisms to detect and  mitigate the spread of misinformation by LLMs [71]\u2013[74], understanding the models'  susceptibility to biases that might lead to the generation of misleading content [75], [76], and  designing training methods to make LLMs more discerning in processing and relaying factual  information [77]\u2013[79]. Studies also focus on the ethical implications of LLM-generated content,  examining the models' potential role in influencing public opinion and shaping discourse [80],  [81]. The challenge lies in equipping LLMs with the ability to evaluate the veracity of input data  and the contextual accuracy of the information they produce [82].     Misinformation in LLMs is a pressing concern, as these models are often taken at their word.  Models can sound convincing and factual in their responses yet produce incorrect or contextually  inappropriate content. Furthermore, inherent unintentional or intentional biases within training  data, or from external sources, may skew the information these models generate. LLMs being  trusted as a source of factual content will complicate user trust in AI more generally, as well as  have implications within regulatory compliance of misinformation.  \n# 4.6.  Accountability and Governance in LLM \nAccountability is a pivotal principle essential for ensuring transparent and auditable decisionmaking processes. It serves as a cornerstone in bolstering public trust and meeting the increasing expectations set by regulatory bodies [83]. Generative Language Models (GLMs) may amplify  and solidify pre-existing biases ingrained within their training data. This tends to produce  misleading or inaccurate information. Consequently, ensuring accountability is of utmost importance when incorporating these models into the Healthcare sector [84]. Healthcare professionals have expressed concerns about added tasks managing technology, the potential risks of unreliable AI recommendations, and the potential loss of human connection in patient care due  to AI integration.[1] \nIn addition to GLMs, the issue of generating misleading information also applies to Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). As confirmed by [85], objects with a high frequency of occurrence or those that co-occur with elements in visual data are particularly susceptible to misinterpretation by LVLMs. The creation of counterfactual speech further complicates the pursuit of accountable  AI. For example, fabricating references in scientific article composition  [86] and inventing\nfictitious legal cases within the legal domain [87] underscore the inherent risks associated with the  utilization of ChatGPT in critical domains. Choudhury et al. [88] underscore the importance of  addressing accountability in healthcare by educating practitioners on how to evaluate AI  recommendations, acknowledging challenges posed by heavy workloads and limited statistical  training. To effectively tackle these hurdles, the paper suggests implementing policies that  establish accountability measures for both clinicians and AI systems, highlighting the importance  of education and regulatory frameworks in the healthcare sector. [84]    The call for greater transparency and accountability in high-stakes AI research requires a  fundamental overhaul of incentives, turning away from rapid advancement that may overlook  meticulous scientific inquiry [89]. This transformation involves acknowledging the critical role of  data work, incentivizing thorough documentation of data origins, and addressing the need to  identify and mitigate any adverse effects [90]. By leveraging established frameworks from  software engineering and infrastructure, fields such as AI and NLP can adopt robust structures to  enforce dataset accountability [91]. Furthermore, integrating human-centric approaches like  interactive model cards [92] holds promise in promoting comprehensive documentation and  accountability within these domains.[93] Moreover, open-source initiatives in conversational text  generators play a critical role in fostering accountability by evaluating and highlighting various  degrees of openness across key dimensions such as data legality, documentation standards, and  accessibility. This impacts fairness and accountability from data collection to model deployment  [94] \nResearch suggests that the scientific language used by AI, such as ChatGPT, might mislead users  about its reliability, which highlights the need for accessible references generated by humans  [95][96][97].  Scholars emphasize the significance of accountability in LLMs by proposing the  integration of a citation mechanism to address issues related to intellectual property, ethics,  transparency, and verifiability. By adopting a citation system that attributes sources, these models  can foster accountability, respect intellectual property rights, and uphold information integrity,  thereby contributing to the development of more responsible and trustworthy AI systems[98][99];  Furthermore, certain frameworks are proposed for dataset accountability [100]. Cacciamani et al.  [101] proposed CANGARU Guidelines for data scientists, which encompass ethical  accountability, reproducibility, disclosure, and proper reporting concerning GAI/GPTs/LLMs in  academic papers, aiming to promote critical adherence among academics, authors, editors,  reviewers, publishers, and readers. \nSome scholars stress the necessity of holding stakeholders accountable in the development and use  of LLMs through external scrutiny methods like red-teaming and auditing, guided by the ASPIRE  framework. Anderljung [102] examines the implementation of an AI system at BlockScience, an  engineering company, where an LLM was integrated into their internal Knowledge Management  System (KMS). This study delves into the challenges and implications of this integration, \nhighlighting the importance of understanding accountability in human-AI interactions within  organizational contexts and the need for strategies aligning AI technologies with human  interests.[103] \n4.7.  Case Studies in LLM ethics\nEthical case studies of LLMs vary across various sectors such as health, academia, education, and  management is also common, with numerous case studies underscoring the nuanced ethical  considerations in each domain. In healthcare, research delves into the implications of LLMs in  patient data confidentiality and consent [104], [105] , medical training and education [106], [107],  and the potential biases in medical recommendations [108], [109]. In academia, studies are  focusing on the impact of LLMs in research integrity [110], [111], plagiarism [111]\u2013[113], and  the changing landscape of academic publishing [114]\u2013[116]. The educational sector's research  scrutinizes LLMs' role in academic misconduct [117], [118], potential biases in educational  content [119], [120], and the ethical use of AI in student evaluations [121]. In management, case  studies revolve around LLMs' influence on decision-making processes [122], biases in workplace  communication automation, and ethical considerations in human resource management [123].  Within ethical training and religion, several studies addressed ethics judgement [124], [125],  dilemmas [126], [127], and the use of LLMs related to religious texts [128].     As demonstrated by the case studies across many sectors, LLMs have wide reaching effects and  implications. Models are being used in both the public and private sector, by corporations,  researchers, and consumers. LLMs are being used to produce, analyze, and evaluate content. This  will likely have far-reaching effects, both positive and negative. Access to specialized or domain  specific knowledge will likely become easier to access, while communication and workflows  across sectors could be made more efficient. However, this streamlining and automation will likely  further exemplify a digital divide within society, as well as the possible replacement of human jobs  in customer service, programming, and other sectors.  \n# 4.8.  Mitigation Strategies in LLM ethics\nMitigating ethical concerns in LLMs is a multifaceted challenge that requires a combination of  technical, ethical, and procedural approaches. Key mitigation strategies include bias mitigation,  privacy protection, and hallucinations prevention [129]\u2013[158] (See Table 5). Most studies on  mitigating ethical concerns in LLMs focus on mitigation of social bias, such as gender bias and  stereotypes. These studies proposed mitigating methods focusing on the training dataset [132],  [136], [143], [147], [155], the training object [129], [147], the training method [131], [135], [140],  [153], [154], [159], [160], and fine-tuning [137], [144], [161]. For example, [132] created  OccuQuest, an instruction-tuning dataset encompassing more than 1,000 different occupations \nacross 26 occupational categories. By fine-tuning LLaMA with OccuQuest, they achieved a model  that outperformed existing state-of-the-art LLaMA variants. [129] proposed an InfoEntropy Loss function that can dynamically evaluate the learning difficulty of specific tokens and adaptively  scale the training loss, directing the model's focus towards tokens that are more challenging to  learn. Experimental results demonstrate that models using the InfoEntropy Loss function  consistently show enhanced performance in downstream benchmarks. [131] propose a novel debiasing technique that incorporates adversarial learning in the pre-training phase of the model. This approach has shown to improve fairness in natural language generation tasks, without  compromising overall performance. Additionally, the benefits in fairness achieved through this  method are transferable to downstream tasks. [137] suggested reducing gender bias by fine-tuning sentence encoders on a task focused on semantic similarity. This task involved sentences that  contained gender stereotypes and their corresponding gender-swapped counterparts, aiming to enforce semantic similarity between these two categories. This approach yielded promising results,  notably achieved with a relatively small amount of training data.    Several studies focused on privacy protection and data security. [134] proposed knowledge unlearning to reduce privacy risks for LLMs. Their study compared the proposed approach with  previously established data preprocessing and decoding methods known for reducing privacy risks  in language models. The findings indicated that knowledge unlearning offers a more robust  empirical privacy guarantee, especially in cases where data susceptible to extraction attacks are  known beforehand. [133] employed a novel two-step Fine-mixing technique along with an Embedding Purification (E-PUR) method, aimed at utilizing clean pre-trained weights to mitigate potential backdoors in word embeddings. They tested this approach against conventional backdoor  mitigation methods across three single-sentence sentiment classification tasks and two sentencepair classification tasks. The results demonstrated that their proposed method significantly  outperformed the baseline methods in all tested scenarios. \nTable 5: Strategies for Ethical LLM: mitigation, protection, prevention\n \nMajor \nstrategies \nKey factors \nExplanations \nReferences \nBias \nMitigation \nDataset \nEnhancement \nExplore methods to improve the diversity and inclusivity of the training dataset.  \n[136],[143], \n[147], [155] \n \nOccupation-\nFocused Tuning \n \nImplement occupation-focused fine-tuning, as demonstrated by OccuQuest, a \nspecialized dataset encompassing various occupations. \n[132] \n \nInfoEntropy Loss \nFunction \nUtilize dynamic evaluation of learning difficulty through functions like InfoEntropy \nLoss to guide the model towards challenging tokens. \n[129] \n  Adversarial  Learning  Integrate adversarial learning during pre-training to address bias in natural language  generation tasks.

This issue often arises due to limitations in the model's understanding of context, over-reliance on patterns in the training data, or gaps in its knowledge base. There are a number of studies focusing on hallucination prevention. [142] introduced a method that detects and mitigates hallucinations during the content generation process. This method initially pinpoints potential hallucinations using the model's logit output values. It then verifies the accuracy of these candidates through a validation step. Upon confirming hallucinations, the approach actively mitigates them before proceeding with the generation process. This proactive detection and mitigation technique effectively reduced the hallucinations in the GPT-3.5 model, decreasing them from an average of 47.5% to 14.5%. [154] conducted a participatory design study that enable everyday users to create interface features, and then generated a list of user-desired features aimed at reducing the impact of hallucinations LLMs on users. \n[137] \nFor an LLM to be transparent is for it to have clear and understandable functioning and  development. Without transparency, there is no trust, as it facilitates accountability, ensuring  ethical and responsible use of LLMs. It enables users to understand, question, and critique the  outputs of these models, making them more robust and reliable tools [162]\u2013[167].  \nEfforts to improve transparency involve developing more interpretable models, documenting and  communicating processes and decisions thoroughly, and engaging in open. [164] introduced the  concept of Chaining LLM steps together, where the output of one step serves as the input for the  following one, cumulatively enhancing the benefits at each stage. Conducted with 20 participants,  their user study revealed that this Chaining approach not only elevated the quality of task results  but also substantially increased the system's transparency, controllability, and the users' perception  of collaboration. [163] proposed four common approaches to achieve transparency in LLMs,  including model reporting, publishing evaluation results, providing explanations, and  communicating uncertainty.  \nHowever, [168] found that although there is a rapidly increasing number of projects claiming to  be \u2018open source\u2019, many of them use undocumented data whose legality is questionable.  Additionally, it was noted that very few of these projects disclose their instruction-tuning processes, which are crucial due to the involvement of human annotation labor. Continuous efforts  are needed to promote transparency in LLMs. \n# 4.10. Censorship in LLM\nCensorship in LLMs refers to the practice of intentionally designing or training these models to  avoid generating certain types of content due to ethical, legal, and societal concerns [169]. While censorship in LLMs can be beneficial for preventing harmful outputs, it raises several concerns.  First, there may be no objective criterion for determining where a content is harmful, and  censorship may compromise free speech or creative expression. Second, undue censorship can  suppress valid and important debates. Third, lack of transparency in censorship policies can lead  to mistrust in the model. In addition, [169] pointed out that the complexities of censorship in  models go beyond merely semantic restrictions. They noted that skilled attackers are capable of  piecing together prohibited outputs by cleverly combining a series of allowed outputs, indicating  a deeper layer of challenges in effectively implementing censorship. \n# 4.11. Intellectual Property and Plagiarism in LLM \nAcademic work in this area addresses the complex challenges posed by these AI systems in  creating content that may infringe on intellectual property rights. Scholars are examining the  ethical implications of using LLMs for generating text, images, or code that closely resemble  copyrighted material, raising questions about originality and ownership [170]. The focus is also  on developing frameworks and guidelines to navigate copyright laws in the context of AIgenerated content, exploring how existing legal structures can accommodate the unique nature of  LLM outputs [171]. Several authors discuss methods of watermarking models and outputs to  protect copyright and intellectual property [172]\u2013[174]. One paper also provides an innovative  take on the subject, arguing that LLMs can be used in copyright compliance checking [175].     Both academic research and mainstream news has recently discussed ownership and copyright  surrounding LLMs and other forms of generative AI. The size and make-up of training datasets  presents challenges in several legal areas, including infringement, fair use, and liability. The debate  surrounding data scraping is both technically and legally complex, while content filtering and  moderation at the scale at which many LLMs operate is highly resource intensive. The future of  LLM copyright will likely be in constant evolution and debate, as many copyright laws were not  designed with AI-generated content in mind.  \n# 4.12. Abusive LLM, hate speech and cyber-bullying \nAbusive language, hate speech, and cyber-bullying in LLMs refer to the generation or facilitatio of harmful content by these AI systems. Managing these aspects is crucial for ensuring that LLM are used in a manner that is safe, respectful, and aligned with societal values and norms. \n  Abusive language occurs when LLMs generate or replicate language that is offensive, derogatory,  or harmful [176], [177]. Hate speech, another concerning output, consists of content that incites  hatred or violence against people or groups based on characteristics like race, religion, gender, or  sexual orientation [178]\u2013[181]. Additionally, LLMs can contribute to cyber-bullying by generating  or aiding in the creation of messages that harass, intimidate, or belittle individuals [182]. These  issues typically arise from LLMs replicating patterns present in their training data, which may  include toxic or abusive content.     In addition, scholars have been utilized LLMs to for abusive language, hate speech, and cyberbullying detection. [177] proposed a method for identifying online sexual predatory chats and  abusive language, utilizing the open-source pre-trained Llama 2 model. The experimental findings  indicate robust effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating high proficiency and consistency  across three different datasets in five sets of experiments. [181] presented a model specifically \nAbusive language occurs when LLMs generate or replicate language that is offensive, derogatory, or harmful [176], [177].

[181] presented a model specifically \ndesigned to measure whether LLMs encode biases that are harmful to the LGBTQ+ community. [182] used ChatGPT-3 to detect cyberbullying on social media platforms. They modified and evaluated the model using well-known cyberbullying datasets, benchmarking it against previous models using standard performance metrics. The findings indicated that the model was an effective method for cyberbullying detection. \n# 4.13. Auditing LLM \n4.13. Auditing LLM \nResearch in this area focuses on developing methodologies to systematically evaluate complex systems for reliability, fairness, and ethical compliance [183]. Auditing involves scrutinizing their decision-making processes, understanding the biases inherent in their training data, and assessing their outputs for accuracy, toxicity, and potential to perpetuate misinformation [184]. Most research reviewed focuses on specific pathways or frameworks to audit LLMs. These include a ChatGPT-powered causal auditor [185], discrete optimization [186], iterative in-context learning [187], and deep learning [188]. Finally, one paper introduces an auditing tool based specifically on human-AI interaction principles [189].  \nDue to the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of many LLMs, auditing tools become increasingly important. Transparency and explainability, key parts of an ethical framework for LLMs, are challenged when the public, and even advanced researchers, are unable to decipher how models process information or arrive at specific conclusions. Frequent updates and the evolving nature of LLMs also necessitates auditing tools and practices that are continuous, not solely at a snapshot in time. The research in this field demonstrates the resource intensity and technical expertise necessary to effectively audit LLMs, likely hindering the ability to perform audits as often as they could and should occur. Finally, a one size fits all approach would likely be ineffective, as LLMs transcend cultural and global boundaries, as well as do not follow a standardized or regulated framework as they exist now.  \n# V. Discussion \n#  The Advantages of Pre-Trained Models in Integrating N\n# ages of Pre-Trained Models in Integrating Normative Eth\nConventional Language Models (CLMs) and Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are two essential models in natural language processing (NLP). CLMs, trained on smaller corpora, predict linguistic sequences causally, estimating probabilities based on preceding contexts. PLMs, in  contrast, use significantly larger corpora and neural networks for pre-training, learning generic knowledge transferred to various tasks via fine-tuning. PLMs diverge from CLMs by employing bidirectional modeling, considering both preceding and succeeding contexts to predict missing units, contrary to the sequential causal prediction of CLMs. Additionally, PLMs introduce token  representation through instances of embedding, enabling versatile handling of linguistic tasks. \nThese differences in training, causality constraints, and token representation distinguish PLMs a an evolution beyond CLMs in NLP, offering broader applicability and enhanced performance across various language-based applications.[2], [190]\u2013[192] \n  Both CLMs and PLMs can be developed with ethical and value-sensitive considerations. However,  PLMs might offer more advantageous starting points due to their ability to incorporate diverse data  sources and fine-tuning mechanisms. The upside of PLMs is their trainability on extensive  datasets, particularly ethical considerations and value-based content. Further, through fine-tuning  and specific training paradigms, PLMs can be directed towards ethical considerations to produce  outputs aligned with values or ethical standards.    Additionally, the normative-descriptive distinction in ethics can shed light on the suitability of  PLMs for creating ethical LLMs. Ethical frameworks often involve normative elements, namely  moral norms or principles guiding behavior. With their capacity for integrating and processing  diverse data, PLMs offer a more robust foundation to include normative components within the  model. PLMs can incorporate diverse ethical principles, guidelines, and values. By fine-tuning or  directing the learning process towards ethical considerations, PLMs can effectively assimilate and  encode normative elements. They excel in understanding the nuances of language usage across  various cultures and ethical contexts, enabling a more intricate representation of normative ethical  frameworks. \nAdditionally, the normative-descriptive distinction in ethics can shed light on the suitability of PLMs for creating ethical LLMs. Ethical frameworks often involve normative elements, namely moral norms or principles guiding behavior.

Embracing Multidisciplinary Perspectives Beyond Engineering for Ethical AI in LLMs  \nAddressing ethical complexities in AI systems, especially LLMs, requires a diverse team and a multifaceted approach. Ethical considerations extend beyond technical aspects and encompass societal, psychological, legal, and philosophical dimensions. The approach involves integrating ethical education, research-based ethics, algorithmic considerations, and developmental ethics in LLMs. Collaboration among ethicists, sociologists, psychologists, legal experts, physicians, computer scientists, and data scientists ensures a holistic understanding of challenges and promotes alignment with societal values. This interdisciplinary dialogue fosters a nuanced approach in designing and implementing LLM models. \nMere reliance on engineering perspectives to address challenges in LLMs, like fairness, risks perpetuating unresolved issues. Engineering approaches may prioritize technical solutions without fully considering societal, ethical, and human-centric dimensions. Fairness in LLMs involves understanding societal biases, cultural contexts, and ethics beyond algorithmic accuracy. Approaching fairness solely from an engineering standpoint can unintentionally embed or amplify existing biases. To effectively address ethical concerns, diverse perspectives from ethicists, social scientists, psychologists, and legal experts must be included. This holistic approach acknowledges the complexity of ethical challenges beyond technical solutions. \n# 5.3. Protecting Privacy in Language Models amidst Growing Data Concerns  \nThe growing literature on safeguarding privacy in LLMs suggest that the training data used in current models may contain sensitive information. This involves a potential risk of reverse engineering or extracting this information from publicly available models. Moreover, as these models gain wider acceptance in commercial or municipal sectors, they are likely to collect and store more personal data, such as bank or credit card numbers, personal identifiers, and other secure information. The retention or deletion of such data will have far-reaching implications for compliance with privacy laws, secure deployment of models, and user trust in these systems. The literature highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, encompassing advanced technical solutions, robust legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines.  \n# 5.4. Ethical Uniqueness: Specialized Considerations for LLMS  \nLLMs bring forth a host of ethical considerations, some of which are shared with other AI systems while others are distinctly amplified due to their advanced capabilities.(See Table 6) The first category encompasses issues common to both LLMs and other AI systems. Privacy concerns and  data security remain pivotal, given the massive datasets these models are trained on. Fairness and  bias mitigation pose ongoing challenges, with the need for dynamic audit tools to navigate the intricate landscape of ethical considerations. \nLLMs bring forth a host of ethical considerations, some of which are shared with other AI systems  while others are distinctly amplified due to their advanced capabilities.(See Table 6) The first  category encompasses issues common to both LLMs and other AI systems.

Fairness and  bias mitigation pose ongoing challenges, with the need for dynamic audit tools to navigate the  intricate landscape of ethical considerations.    However, LLMs introduce a second category, consisting of ethical issues notably exacerbated in  their context. Transparency and accountability become intricate dilemmas as the black-box nature  of LLMs makes it difficult to assign responsibility for generated content. Access and inequality  are heightened concerns, reflecting the unequal distribution of LLM benefits and exacerbating  existing societal disparities. Additionally, the propensity for LLMs to generate abusive language  and contribute to cyber-bullying underscores the need for targeted ethical frameworks in their  deployment. While these issues are not exclusive to LLMs, the nature and capabilities of LLMs  notably amplify these concerns.    The third category delves into ethical issues unique to LLMs. Hallucination and misinformation,  stemming from the models' capacity to generate fabricated content, present novel challenges.  Intellectual property and plagiarism concerns, particularly in the realm of copyright, require  careful consideration to navigate the murky waters of content creation. Decoding censorship  complexities becomes paramount, as LLMs may inadvertently contribute to or challenge existing  censorship norms, raising profound ethical dilemmas.

Decoding censorship  complexities becomes paramount, as LLMs may inadvertently contribute to or challenge existing  censorship norms, raising profound ethical dilemmas.   \nTable 6: Navigating Ethical Frontiers: Classifying Concerns in LLMs \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/6bf0/6bf05055-2782-47ff-a3c6-33a2a490f2f8.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n# 5.5. Hallucination and Distorted Realities in LLMs\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">5.5. Hallucination and Distorted Realities in LLMs</div>\nHallucination in LLMs is a significant ethical concern in artificial intelligence. It refers to the  generation of false, misleading, or fictional content without grounding in data or facts. These  inaccuracies pose ethical ramifications, compromising reliability and perpetuating misinformation.  As LLMs are increasingly used for decision-making and communication, unchecked hallucination amplifies the risk of spreading falsehoods, causing societal discord, eroding trust in AI systems,  and distorting perceptions of truth and reality. Addressing hallucination goes beyond technical  challenges and requires proactive measures, validation mechanisms, and interdisciplinary collaboration to uphold AI system integrity and societal impact. \n# 5.6. Verifiable Accountability and Citation Integrity System in LLMs   \nThe incorporation of effective citation and reference systems in LLMs is a crucial step in  strengthening their ethical foundation. By implementing a system that accurately attributes  sources, these models can establish a clear traceability, promoting accountability and integrity in  the content they generate. This practice not only enhances transparency by acknowledging the  origin of information but also addresses ethical concerns related to intellectual property rights and  data authenticity. Ethical considerations in LLMs require a shift towards comprehensive  documentation and citation practices, ensuring proper acknowledgment of contributors, preventing  plagiarism, and maintaining the accuracy of disseminated information. Moreover, citation  mechanisms can play a key role in promoting responsible use of LLMs, fostering a culture of  trustworthiness, scrutiny, and verifiability in their development, evaluation, and usage. \n# 5.7. Diversifying Case Studies in LLMs \nRecent case studies of the ethical implications of LLMs can be classified into various fields Healthcare [104], [105], Academia [110], [111], Education [117], [118],[119], [120] Managemen [122], [123]. Ethical Training and Religion: Moral judgment, dilemmas, and the use of LLM\nregarding religious texts [124], [125], [126], [127], [128]. Expanding case studies into diverse fields is crucial for thoroughly addressing ethical considerations surrounding LLMs. Different sectors present complexities and ethical dilemmas of their own, and case studies shed light on specific challenges in each domain. Insights from diverse case studies inform tailored mitigation strategies to optimize LLM benefits while addressing domain-specific challenges. Moreover, comprehensive case studies inform policymaking, guiding inclusive and effective regulations for LLM use across applications.  \n# 5.8. Decoding Censorship Complexity in LLMs  \nThe problem of censorship in LLMs raises intricate challenges beyond subjective judgments and transparency issues. While some excerpted passages highlight the multifaceted challenges surrounding censorship in LLMs, further examination reveals nuanced aspects integral to understanding the complexities of content moderation and its broader impact. A careful consideration of ethical principles is essential to arrive at a balance between protecting users from harmful content and securing free speech and diverse perspectives. Moreover, Censorship in LLMs might inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the data used for training these models. Biased training data could result in biased censorship, disproportionately affecting certain groups or viewpoints. It is crucial to address algorithmic biases and ensure fairness in the censorship process.   Static censorship rules may not adequately adapt to the dynamic and context-dependent nature of online content. Models should be designed to evolve in response to the changing landscape of content and societal norms. Furthermore, implementing a uniform censorship policy across diverse regions may neglect cultural differences and diverse legal frameworks. Different regions and cultures have varying standards and laws regarding acceptable or unacceptable content. In addition to the mentioned challenges, exploring how individuals attempt to circumvent censorship measures can provide insights into evasion strategies and effective countermeasures to address these techniques. \n# 5.9. Breaking the Black Box and Crafting Dynamic Audit Tools for LLMs  \nAddressing the ethical challenges of opacity in LLMs requires adaptable auditing solutions. The  lack of transparency and explainability in LLMs hinders effective auditing due to their \"black box\"  nature. The dynamic nature of these models and resource-intensive auditing practices pose obstacles to frequent assessments. Additionally, the absence of standardized frameworks and  diverse cultural contexts make a universal auditing approach impractical. \nOne potential solutions to the challenge of opacity in LLMs are dynamic auditing frameworks or  tools tailored for LLMs. These frameworks prioritize continuous monitoring and assessment,  adapting alongside model updates for ongoing transparency and accountability. Machine learning-\nbased auditing tools that evolve with the models themselves, incorporating interpretability  techniques, such as explainable AI (XAI) methods or model-agnostic approaches, can offer  insights into LLM decision-making processes without requiring deep understanding of their  internals. Moreover, a modular auditing framework customizable for cultural nuances and specific  application contexts can enhance effectiveness. This approach requires collaboration among  interdisciplinary teams, including ethicists, technologists, and domain experts, to create adaptable  auditing models that consider diverse perspectives. \n# VI.  Conclusion and Future directions \nThe growing interest in LLMs calls for a closer look at their ethical implications, especially as they become more advanced than humans. This area is attracting attention from researchers and ethicists, who are exploring how LLMs' ethical duties might go beyond usual human-focused ethics. It's important to understand how a country's ethics, its government, and the ethics of AI entities in that country differ. As LLMs gain more influence over how information is shared, we need to pay more attention to the ethical responsibilities that come with this power.    The ethical challenges posed by LLMs are distinct and require immediate action due to their advanced capabilities and growing popularity. Unlike other AI systems, LLMs specifically grapple with problems like hallucination, verifiable accountability, and decoding censorship. These problems must be tackled to maintain responsibility, reduce unfairness, increase clarity, and limit negative effects on society. By prioritizing these ethical dimensions surrounding LLMs, we can responsibly steer their development and influence the direction of AI ethics and governance.    By highlighting various case studies surrounding LLM ethics, we can create a more nuanced understanding of the larger picture. As described, LLMs are becoming more commonly used in various sectors, including healthcare, academia, education, management, training, and religion. The highlighted case studies showcase differing strategies to discuss ethics, as well as the nuanced problems that occur based on sector.  The quantitative examination of ethical scopes in Large Language Model (LLM) studies, as depicted in the provided data, offers valuable insights into the distribution and emphasis of ethical concerns within this domain (See, Figure 2). Notably, case studies, mitigation strategies, and accountability and governance attract a higher volume of scholarly attention, showcasing a substantial body of research dedicated to understanding and addressing real-world implications and responsible practices concerning LLMs. Conversely, categories such as censorship, transparency, and intellectual property and plagiarism exhibit lower publication metrics, hinting at potential gaps in comprehensive ethical investigations and warranting more scholarly focus. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/1980/19802267-069f-4120-b85a-2da30029cea6.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nMoving forward, future directions in ethical inquiries regarding LLMs could aim to bridge these  identified gaps and extend the discourse. Emphasis should be placed on cultivating a more  balanced exploration across all ethical frameworks to ensure a holistic comprehension of the  ethical landscape surrounding LLMs.   Furthermore, since LLM technologies are still evolving, there should be continuous ethical  scrutiny and adaptation. Regarding LLM-related ethical challenges, future studies should  continually reassess and adapt ethical frameworks to keep pace with technological progress. This  will help foster responsible and accountable development, deployment, and use of LLMs while  mitigating potential ethical problems and societal harms. \n# REFERENCES\nREFERENCES \n[1]  P. S.
