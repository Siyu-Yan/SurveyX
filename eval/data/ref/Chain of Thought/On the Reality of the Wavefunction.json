Associating a wavefunction with each system, QM provides very accurate predictions about the possible measurement outcomes. However, the axioms of QM are silent about the nature of the wavefunction, i.e., these axioms are logically consistent with several different ontological statuses of the wavefunction. The Ontological Models Framework (OMF) introduced by Harrigan and Spekkens [1], is an attempt to provide a general formalism by which one can evaluate the ontology of the quantum theory and specifically the ontology of the wavefunction in realistic interpretations of QM. Leifer explains [2] that one can choose one of the following three philosophical stands toward the wavefunction\u2019s interpretation. 1. Antirealist Epistemic: Wavefunctions are epistemic, and there is not any deeper reality behind them. 2. Realist Epistemic: Wavefunctions are epistemic, but there is an underlying reality. 3. Realist Ontic: There is an underlying reality, and the wavefunctions correspond to the states of reality. Options one and two are called \u03c8-epistemic views. In these views, one interprets the wavefunction as a mathematical object which merely represents the agent\u2019s knowledge of the quantum systems. Option three is referred to as the \u03c8-ontic view, within which the wavefunction is considered to be a real object corresponding to an underlying reality of systems; such an object exists independently of the observer [3]. An important question is whether it is possible in principle to construct a realist \u03c8epistemic interpretation of QM (option two), or whether a realist is compelled to think ontologically about wavefunctions. PBR try to answer this question, and their answer is negative. In their famous article [4], PBR introduce an operational scenario whose statistics cannot be reproduced by \u03c8-epistemic ontological models. PBR concluded that there is no way of having a realist epistemic interpretation of \u03c8 (option two); thus, the only remaining option for a realist is to choose option three. The logical structure of the PBR\u2019s argumentation can be expressed in the following way. There is a contradiction between the statistics of quantum theory (P1) and the statistics of \u03c8-epistemic ontological models (P2) if one accepts a seemingly reasonable assumption about the ontological structure of the ontic states of a composite system, called the \u201cPreparation\nOptions one and two are called \u03c8-epistemic views.

Most of these suggestions can be classified into three categories.\n1. Rejection of P1. In this category, one can argue that maybe QM\u2019s predictions are no always true. The idea of having null-measurements (measurements with no outcome [5], or detection-inefficiency loophole [6] can be considered in this class.\n2. Rejection of P2. Another option is to accept the above contradiction, as a clue of a subtle constraint on accepting the \u03c8-epistemic models. PBR themselves claimed that for a realist person, the only remaining option is to be a \u03c8-ontologist [4].\n4. Rejection of P4. Except for the arguments from antirealists, who entirely reject the existence of an underlying reality behind the quantum states, there is no serious criticism of the PBR\u2019s theorem which can be classified in this category. However, the argument provided in this study falls into this category.\nThis research highlights an incorrect conclusion in PBR\u2019s arguments, which was made due to inadequacies in the definitions of OMF. To be precise, OMF models the ontology of the preparation procedure, but it does not model the ontology of the measurement device. Such an asymmetric treatment becomes problematic, in scenarios in which measurement devices have a quantum nature. Modifying the OMF definition so that we can insert the ontology of the measurement procedure into our analysis, we can see that PBR\u2019s contradiction is not because of the \u03c8-epistemic models. Rather, the problem is in the heart of our framework (OMF). I refer this modified version of the OMF as to \u201cMOMF\u201d (Modified Ontological Models Framework).\n(1.1)\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/2365/2365766c-2537-4720-9cb0-4c81cda56509.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: The schematic of an operational PM scenario.

A review of the OMF\u2019s definitions and how they relate to the axioms of QM, as well as a precise description of PBR\u2019s scenario in OMF, are provided in section two. Pointing out the problem of the \u03c8-epistemic ontological models caused by OMF, the mathematical structure of the MOMF formalism followed by a statement of the PBR\u2019s theorem within MOMF are discussed in section three. There, We will see how without using any further assumptions, the problem of the \u03c8-epistemic models can be solved in MOMF. In conclusion, by reviewing all the mentioned ideas, it will be argued that PBR\u2019s finding does not provide any implication for the nature of the wavefunction, rather what they have found shows us that we should be more careful about the way we model the ontology of QM.\n# 2 OMF and the PBR Theorem\n# 2.1 Operational QM\nConsider an operational PM scenario, i.e., a scenario in which a system is prepared via a procedure/device P, and then measured via a procedure/device M. In this situation, the interaction between the prepared system and the measurement device results in an outcome for which QM provides us the associated probability of finding that outcome. Figure (1) depicts such a scenario. According to QM, we can express the following axioms for describing such a situation.\n# Definition 2.1. Operational QM posits the following two axioms to describe a PM scenario [9].\nAxiom 2.1 (Preparation). A preparation P is associated to a trace one positive operator \u03c1, known as the density operator, acting on the Hilbert space H. Axiom 2.2 (Measurement). A measurement M is associated with a positive operator valued measure (POVM) {Mm} such that \u2211m Mm = I. Finally, the probability of a measurement M yielding outcome m, given a preparation procedure P, is\nAxiom 2.1 (Preparation). A preparation P is associated to a trace one positive operator \u03c1, known as the density operator, acting on the Hilbert space H. Axiom 2.2 (Measurement). A measurement M is associated with a positive operator valued measure (POVM) {Mm} such that \u2211m Mm = I. Finally, the probability of a measurement M yielding outcome m, given a preparation procedure P, is\npr(m \u2223P,M) = Tr(Mm\u03c1).\n# ( \u2223) = 2.2 Ontological Models Framework\nTo investigate the ontological status of \u03c8, one needs an ontological framework. Such a framework cannot be inferred directly from the axioms of QM. What we can do, is to look for an ontological model whose structure is constrained by the fact that the predictions of the ontological model and the operational ones, should be equal. In 2007, Harrigan and Spekkens proposed a framework called \u201cOntological Models Framework (OMF)\u201d [1] aiming to provide the most general formalism for realistic interpretations of quantum scenarios. The basic idea of OMF is to associate an ontic state space \u039b = {\u03bbi} with each physical system. This space is supposed to be the space of all the possible ontic states \u03bbi of a system in the sense that the ontic states are the real states of a system which are independent of our observation, information and what so ever. Following [1], we have the following three definitions.\nDefinition 2.2. OMF posits an ontic state space \u039b and prescribes a probability distribution over \u039b for every preparation procedure P, denoted by a density function pr(\u03bb \u2223P), and a probability distribution over the different outcomes Mm of a measurement M for every ontic state \u03bb \u2208\u039b, denoted by a response function pr(m \u2223\u03bb,M). Finally, for all P and M, it must satisfy the conditions\n\u2211 \u222b\u039b pr(\u03bb \u2223P)pr(m \u2223\u03bb,M)d\u03bb = pr(m \u2223P,M) = Tr(Mm\u03c1)\n\u222b( \u2223)( \u2223) =( \u2223) =() where \u03c1 is the density operator associated with P and Mm is the POVM element associated with the m-th outcome of measurement M.\nThe idea of OMF is straightforward; As an operational theory, quantum theory associates an operational state \u03c1 with each preparation procedure. But, since we are not sure whether \u03c1 is the system\u2019s ontic state (\u03bb) or not, we should simulate the ontic level of \u03c1 by the expression pr(\u03bb \u2223P). After this simulation, the probabilities of finding different measurement outcomes will depend on the ontic states of the preparation procedure, expressed\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/5b66/5b665d1d-cf0f-4cca-80fc-ac3832c6d228.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: A demonstration of \u03c8-ontic (upper graph) and \u03c8-epistemic (lower graph) ontological models.

If an ontological model fails to be \u03c8-ontic, then it is said to be \u03c8 epistemic.\nThe upper graph of figure (2) depicts the ontic state space of a \u03c8-ontic ontological model, in which, there is no shared \u03bb between two preparation procedures. The lower graph shows a \u03c8-epistemic ontological model. In \u03c8-ontic models, two operationally distinct states (say \u2223x+\u27e9and \u2223z+\u27e9) are ontologically distinct too. In \u03c8-epistemic models, there exists (at least) one ontic state which is compatible with two different operational states. So far, all of our statements about OMF have considered the single-party PM scenarios (a single system is assumed to be prepared and then measured). In this sense, OMF aims to provide the most general ontological structure behind the operational PM scenario. However, most of the problematic scenarios in foundations of QM are multipartite ones. For instance, the Bell and the PBR scenarios are both about two systems which are going to be joined to create a single composite system. Proposition 2.1. For systems A and B whose hypothetical composite system AB is (operationally) prepared and measured by PAB and M AB, bipartite OMF posits an ontic state space \u039bAB and prescribes a probability distribution over \u039bAB for every preparation\nprocedure PAB, denoted by a density function pr(\u03bbAB \u2223PAB), and a probability distribution over the different outcomes mAB of a measurement M AB for every ontic state \u03bbAB \u2208\u039bAB, denoted by a response function pr(mAB \u2223\u03bbAB,M AB). Finally, for all PAB and M AB, it will satisfy the following three conditions\n\u2211 ( \u2223) = \u222b\u039b pr(\u03bbAB \u2223PAB)pr(mAB \u2223\u03bbAB,M AB)d\u03bbAB = pr(mAB \u2223PAB,M AB) = Tr(M AB m \u03c1AB)\n\u222b ( \u2223)( \u2223) =( \u2223) =( ) where \u03c1AB is the density operator associated with PAB and M AB m is the POVM element associated with the m-th outcome of measurement M AB.\n\u222b ( \u2223)( \u2223) =( \u2223) =( ) where \u03c1AB is the density operator associated with PAB and M AB m is the POVM element associated with the m-th outcome of measurement M AB. Proof. This proposition is derivable from the axioms of operational QM, plus the OMF definition. Consider two systems A and B, for which we don\u2019t know anything regarding their preparation and measurement procedures. According to the OMF definition, define an ontological model for their \u201csingle\u201d composite system AB. Definition 2.5. Consider two pure states, \u03c8A and \u03c8B, prepared independently at two space-like separated points. From the OMF definition, these operational states correspond to the ontic states \u03bbA \u2208\u039bA and \u03bbB \u2208\u039bB, respectively. If we combine these two systems to create the composite system AB, which is described operationally by \u03c8AB = \u03c8A \u2297\u03c8B, the Preparation Independence Postulate (PIP in OMF) assumes that the ontic state of this composite system can be modeled in the following way.\nProof.

In the original example of PBR, Alice can choose to prepare her state in either \u22230A\u27e9or \u2223+A\u27e9. Similarly, Bob can prepare his state in either \u22230B\u27e9or \u2223+B\u27e9(PBR express these statements, by demanding two copies of the same prepared system).\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n) (2.7)\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\nAccording to figure (2), an arbitrary \u03c8-epistemic ontological model implies that Alice and Bob have the overlaps \u2206A and \u2206B in the probability distributions over their ontic state spaces \u039bA and \u039bB. Since these people are living in two space-like separated regions, there is not any operational correlation between their preparation procedures. Hence, according to the operational QM the following relation holds,\n\u03c8AB = \u03c8A \u2297\u03c8B.\n#  = \u2297 So, there are four possibilities for preparing the composite system AB, \u03c8AB \u2208{\u03c81 AB,\u03c82 AB,\u03c83 AB,\u03c84 AB}\n#  = \u2297 So, there are four possibilities for preparing the composite system AB,  \u2208{ }\n#  = \u2297 So, there are four possibilities for preparing the composite system AB,\n\u03c8AB \u2208{\u03c81 AB,\u03c82 AB,\u03c83 AB,\u03c84 AB}\n \u2208{ } where \u03c81 AB = \u22230A\u27e9\u2297\u22230B\u27e9, \u03c82 AB = \u22230A\u27e9\u2297\u2223+B\u27e9, \u03c83 AB = \u2223+A\u27e9\u2297\u22230B\u27e9and \u03c84 AB = \u2223+A\u27e9\u2297\u2223+B\u27e9. As it can be seen in figure (3), in general, the support of the composite ontic state \u03bbAB is composed of nine mutually exclusive sub-regions.\nsupp(\u03bbAB \u2223\u03c8AB) = R11 \ufffdR12 \ufffd... \ufffdR33\n( \u2223) = \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Also, note that corresponding to each operational state \u03c8i AB there exists a particular region of \u039bAB, to which the ontic state \u03bbAB will be restricted. For instance, if the composite system has been prepared in \u03c81 AB = \u22230A\u27e9\u2297\u22230B\u27e9, one can infer that Alice and Bob have prepared their systems in \u22230A\u27e9and \u22230B\u27e9, respectively. In this situation, \u03bbAB will be restricted to the region R31 \ufffdR32 \ufffdR21 \ufffdR22. In general, we have the following four formulas.\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 ( \u2223 ) = \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd From the above equations, it is evident that R22 is the only region of \u039bAB which is repeating in all of the four equations. This means that R22 is compatible with all of the four possible preparation procedures of \u03c8AB. While the first assumption of PIP (2.8) implies that R22 = \u2206A\u00d7\u2206B, its second assumption (2.9) implies that the ontic state \u03bbAB = (\u03bbA,\u03bbB) of each run of the experiment will be chosen from R22 with the non-zero probability q = \u2223\u2206A\u00d7\u2206B\u2223 \u2223supp(\u03bbAB\u2223\u03c8AB)\u2223> 0. As we will see in the next pages, \u03c8-epistemic models cannot reproduce PBR statistics because of the appearance of R22. In other words, R22 is a problematic region in \u03c8-epistemic models. So far, we have reviewed many details of PBR preparation procedure. Before explicitly expressing the main theorem, PBR measurement procedure should also be known.\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n(2.12)\n(2.13)\nPBR define their measurement procedure to be M AB = {M AB 1 ,M AB 2 ,M AB 3 ,M AB 4 }, which is defined as follows.\n= \u221a (\u2223+\u27e9\u2223\u2212\u27e9+ \u2223\u2212\u27e9\u2223+\u27e9) It can be verified that elements of the above set constitute a complete, two-by-two orthogonal basis corresponding to four possible outcomes of a measurement device M AB. This measurement procedure is entangled, meaning that the elements of this set cannot be separated into two parts, M AB i \u2260(M A i ,M B i ).\n\u2260(  ) Theorem 2.1 (PBR Theorem). Assuming PIP, the (operational) PBR scenario canno be (ontologically) reproduced by \u03c8-epistemic ontological models.\nProof. To clearly show that PBR\u2019s scenario is not reproducible by any \u03c8-epistemic ontological models, let us express the arguments step-by-step. Step 1. Consider a \u03c8-epistemic ontological model which is supposed to reproduce our operational statistics. Placing the PIP assumption in proposition (2.1) results in the following equations for the PBR composite system.\npr(mAB \u2223PAB,M AB) = Tr(M AB m \u03c1AB) = \u222b\u039bAB d\u03bbABpr(\u03bbAB \u2223PAB)pr(mAB \u2223\u03bbAB,M AB) = \u222b\u039bA \u222b\u039bB d\u03bbAd\u03bbBpr(\u03bbA \u2223PA)pr(\u03bbB \u2223PB)pr(mAB \u2223M \npr(mAB \u2223PAB,M AB) = Tr(M AB m \u03c1AB) = \u222b\u039bAB d\u03bbABpr(\u03bbAB \u2223PAB)pr(mAB \u2223\u03bbAB,M AB) = \u222b\u039bA \u222b\u039bB d\u03bbAd\u03bbBpr(\u03bbA \u2223PA)pr(\u03bbB \u2223PB)pr(mAB \u2223M AB,\u03bbA,\u03bbB) (2.15\n\u222b ( \u2223)( \u2223) = \u222b\u039b \u222b\u039b d\u03bbAd\u03bbBpr(\u03bbA \u2223PA)pr(\u03bbB \u2223PB)pr(mAB \u2223M AB,\u03bbA,\u03bbB)\n\u222b \u222b ( \u2223)( \u2223)( \u2223) Step 2. Our ontological model must be able to reproduce compatible statistics with the following two observations. Observation 1: The measurement device can select only the outcomes which are not orthogonal to the prepared state. So the probability of choosing an outcome which is orthogonal to the prepared state is zero. This observation leads to four equations at the operational level of QM.\n(2.14)\n(2.15)\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/98d0/98d0cf72-37ec-4ca9-a1c1-021500d213b9.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3: The ontic state space \u039bAB of an arbitrary \u03c8-epistemic ontological model.

In this step, we check whether our model can satisfy our observations, in equations (2.18) and (2.19), consistently or not. First of all, remember that in \u03c8-epistemic models the ontic state \u03bbAB comes from the the overlap region R22 = \u2206A \u00d7 \u2206B at q = \u2223\u2206A\u00d7\u2206B\u2223 \u2223supp(\u03bbAB\u2223\u03c8AB)\u2223of the times. Hence, regardless of which preparation procedure will be chosen by Alice and Bob, there is always the possibility of having the ontic states being in this region \u03bbAB \u2208\u2206A \u00d7 \u2206B. In what follows, we will see that it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy (2.18) and (2.19), exactly because of the appearance of R22 Now, add the left and the right sides of the four equations of (2.18) to each other, respectively. This leads to the following equation.\n\u03a34 i=1pr(mAB = i \u2223\u03bbA,\u03bbB,M AB) = 0 \u22601, when \u03bbAB \u2208R\n=( = \u2223) = \u2260 \u2208 Comparing (2.19) and (2.20), one can proof the PBR theorem; At q of the times, when the ontic state \u03bbAB \u2208R22, a \u03c8-epistemic model cannot consistently reproduce our demanded statistics. Remark 2.1. According to the above calculations, it seems to be impossible to reproduce the statistics of the PBR scenario with \u03c8-epistemic models.

However,\n=( = \u2223) = \u2260 \u2208 Comparing (2.19) and (2.20), one can proof the PBR theorem; At q of the times, when the ontic state \u03bbAB \u2208R22, a \u03c8-epistemic model cannot consistently reproduce our demanded statistics.\n=( = \u2223) = \u2260 \u2208 Comparing (2.19) and (2.20), one can proof the PBR theorem; At q of the times, when the ontic state \u03bbAB \u2208R22, a \u03c8-epistemic model cannot consistently reproduce our demanded\nRemark 2.1. According to the above calculations, it seems to be impossible to reproduce the statistics of the PBR scenario with \u03c8-epistemic models. PBR concluded that this contradiction reveals that \u03c8 should not be interpreted as a real epistemic object. However, in the following pages, it will be shown that this contradiction appears because there is a problem in the definition of OMF, and this contradiction has nothing to do with the nature of the wavefunction.\n# 3 MOMF and the PBR Theorem\nA careful investigation of the given proof of the PBR theorem within OMF suggests that the problem of PBR\u2019s theorem is neither due to the nature of \u03c8 nor due to the \u03c8-epistemic\n(2.18)\n(2.19)\n(2.20)\nmodels. Rather, it seems that OMF is not capable enough in describing the measurement procedures performed on the entangled basis. According to the OMF\u2019s definition, the response functions depend on the ontic states of the preparation device {\u03bb} and the operational states of the measurement apparatus {Mm}. This means that, although OMF considers the ontology of the preparation procedure, asymmetrically it does not consider the ontology of the measurement device. Such a treatment becomes problematic, especially in scenarios in which measurement devices have a quantum nature. In such circumstances, the preparation, and the measurement devices create a composite system whose behavior depends on the ontic states of both P and M. Let us denote the corresponding ontic states of P and M by \u03bbP and \u03bbM, respectively. Needless to say, the measurement procedure of PBR\u2019s scenario is an entangled one implying that the quantum nature of M is crucially important. Allowing the response functions to depend on \u03bbP and \u03bbM, in the following subsections, we will find that there is no contradiction between the PBR operational statistics and the predictions of the \u03c8-epistemic models.\n# 3.1 Modified Ontological Models Framework\nDefinition 3.1. MOMF posits an ontic state space \u039bPM whose elements \u03bbPM \u2208\u039bPM are ontologically responsible for the results of the experiment. The following three conditions must be satisfied in this framework.   \n\u2211 ( \u2223) = \u222b\u039bP M d\u03bbPMpr(\u03bbPM \u2223P,M)pr(m \u2223\u03bbPM) = pr(m \u2223P,M) = Tr(Mm\u03c1)\n\u222b( \u2223)( \u2223) =( \u2223) =() The above definition is too general and even useless in most of the cases. However, putting some reasonable constraints on this definition converts it into a more useful form. For instance, one can reasonably assume that P and M are operationally uncorrelated. Then, by exploiting an auxiliary assumption which mirrors the operational independence of P and M to the ontological level, the following statement can be obtained. Definition 3.2. Within MOMF, in the absence of operational correlations between the preparation and measurement procedures, the PM-Separability assumption posits that the ontic state spaces of these devices, \u039bP and \u039bM, are ontologically separable. This assumption is expressible as the conjunction of the two following sub-assumptions: \u039bPM = \u039bP \u00d7 \u039bM \u2261\u03bbPM = (\u03bbP,\u03bbM) (3.4)\n(3.1) (3.2)\n(3.1) (3.2) (3.3)\n(3.4)\npr(\u03bbPM \u2223P,M) = pr(\u03bbP \u2223P)pr(\u03bbM \u2223M)\n( \u2223) =( \u2223)( \u2223) The ideas of the PM-Separability assumption and the PIP assumption are very similar; in the absence of operational correlations between two events, one may assume that these events are ontologically uncorrelated too. As will be explained later, such auxiliary assumptions are not necessarily reasonable. However, the purpose of this paper is to show that even if we accept PBR\u2019s assumption, their conclusion does not follow.\nProposition 3.1. Making the PM-Separability assumption has the following result. MOMF posits two ontic state spaces \u039bP, \u039bM and prescribes two probability distributions over them for all states of P and M, denoted density functions pr(\u03bbP \u2223P) and pr(\u03bbM \u2223M) and a probability distribution over the different outcomes m of a measurement M for every pair of ontic states (\u03bbP,\u03bbM) \u2208\u039bP \u00d7\u039bM, denoted response function pr(m \u2223\u03bbP,\u03bbM). Finally, for all P and M, it must satisfy the four following conditions\n\u222b \u222b( \u2223)( \u2223) \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd ( \u2223) \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd where \u03c1 is the density operator associated with P and Mm is the POVM element associa with the m-th outcome of measurement M.\nProof. Plugging the PM-separability assumption in MOMF definition leads to this propo sition.\nEquation (3.9) shows the reasonableness of the previous statements; that for simulating the ontology of an operational scenario, one needs both ontic states \u03bbP and \u03bbM. Although MOMF approaches symmetrically toward the preparation and measurement procedure, there is a conceptual difference between the forms of \u039bP and \u039bM. In principle, it is possible for different preparation methods to share some ontic states in their supports (this is the definition of \u03c8-epistemic models). However, in the measurement ontic state space \u039bM, this statement cannot hold, meaning that different regions of the ontic space\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/b3f8/b3f8deff-27fe-4332-b109-552de749df08.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4: The ontic space of a measurement device is composed of several non-overlapping regions corresponding to its several outcomes.

Note that the outcomes of a measurement device correspond to different orthogonal POVM. Hence, from the operational points of view, the probability of being in an (operational) state which is compatible with two orthogonal POVMs is equal to zero. This operational claim can be confirmed by our daily experience, where we have never seen a measurement\u2019s pointer being in two different outcomes at the same time. From the ontological points of view, one should note that \u039bM must be composed of several non-overlapping regions, corresponding to several measurement outcomes. Otherwise, we could have a set of shared ontic states \u03bbM, each of which being (ontologically) compatible with (operationally) incompatible states. Hence, via mirroring the observations coming from the operational level of QM into the ontological level, we have the following assumption. Figure (4) depicts this situation. Assumption 3.1. The ontic state space of a measurement device, \u039bM, is composed of different non-overlapping regions, \u2206M i , corresponding to its several outcomes.

Finally, for all PAB and M AB, it must satisfy all the following conditions\n(3.10)\n( \u2223) = \u222b\u039bP  \u222b\u039bM d\u03bbP ABd\u03bbM ABpr(\u03bbP AB \u2223PAB)pr(\u03bbM AB \u2223M AB)pr(mAB \u2223\u03bbP AB,\u03bbM AB)\n\u222b  \u222b (  \u2223)(  \u2223)( \u2223 ) Proof.

First of all, let us explicitly express all the constraints on MOMF entailed by PBR\u2019s scenario.\n1. We assume that the PM separability assumption is valid, \u039bPM = \u039bP \u00d7 \u039bM \u2261\u03bbPM = (\u03bbP,\u03bbM) pr(\u03bbPM \u2223PM) = pr(\u03bbP \u2223P)pr(\u03bbM \u2223M)\n( \u2223) =( \u2223)( \u2223) 2.

According to PBR\u2019s scenario, the preparation procedures are operationally separable, PAB = (PA,PB) (3.19) \u03c1 = \u03c1 \u2297\u03c1 (3.20)\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n(3.14)\n(3.15)\n(3.16)\n(3.17) (3.18)\n(3.17)\n(3.20)\n(  \u2223) =(  \u2223)(  \u2223) 5.

Figure (5) depicts the preparation and measurement ontic state spaces \u039bP AB and \u039bM AB, separately. As it was already explained, the overlap region \u2206P A \u00d7 \u2206P B is a problematic region for \u03c8-epistemic OMF models. A three-dimensional representation of this problematic region is provided in figure (6). In what follows, we are going to prove that \u03c8epistemic models can reproduce PBR statistics without any contradiction if the ontic states of the measurement device become involved.\nStep 1. In this step, by combing the above constraints on MOMF definition, we derive further required equations. Making the PIP and the PM separability assumptions, the total ontic state space \u039bPM AB can be obtained as follows,\n\u039bPM AB = \u039bP AB \u00d7 \u039bM AB = \u039bP A \u00d7 \u039bP B \u00d7 \u039bM AB\n =  \u00d7  =  \u00d7  \u00d7 Exactly similar to (2.12), the support of the preparation ontic state, supp(\u03bbP AB), is com posed nine mutually exclusive sub-regions. supp(\u03bbP AB \u2223PAB) = RP 11 \ufffdRP 12 \ufffd... \ufffdRP 33 (3.27\n(3.21)\n(3.22)\n(3.22) (3.23)\n(3.23)\n(3.24)\n(3.25)\n(3.26)\n(3.27)\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/7080/7080135a-423c-427d-8bf5-d85573474cbe.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 5: The preparation and measurement ontic state spaces \u039bP AB and \u039bM AB for the PBR\u2019s scenario.

In this step, PBR\u2019s observations will be expressed within MOMF. Observation 1: Our measurement device can select the outcomes which are non orthogonal to the prepared state. So the probability of choosing an outcome which is orthogonal to the prepared state is zero. This observation leads to the four following equations on the operational level,\noperational level \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 pr(mAB = 1 \u2223\u03c8AB = \u22230A0B\u27e9,M AB) = Tr(M AB 1 \u03c11 AB) = 0 pr(mAB = 2 \u2223\u03c8AB = \u22230A+B\u27e9,M AB) = Tr(M AB 2 \u03c12 AB) = 0 pr(mAB = 3 \u2223\u03c8AB = \u2223+A0B\u27e9,M AB) = Tr(M AB 3 \u03c13 AB) = 0 pr(mAB = 4 \u2223\u03c8AB = \u2223+A+B\u27e9,M AB) = Tr(M AB 4 \u03c14 AB) = 0\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 ( = \u2223 = \u2223++\u27e9) =( ) = Combining the above results with equations (3.28) and (3.30), one can convert this se of four operational equations into the following set of equations at the ontic (MOMF) leve of QM.\nontic level \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 pr(mAB = 1 \u2223\u03bbP A,\u03bbP B,\u03bbM AB) = 0 when \u03bbPM AB \u2208(RP 21 \ufffdRP 22 \ufffdRP 31 \ufffdRP 32) \u00d7 (\u2206M 1 ) pr(mAB = 2 \u2223\u03bbP A,\u03bbP B,\u03bbM AB) = 0 when \u03bbPM AB \u2208(RP 11 \ufffdRP 12 \ufffdRP 21 \ufffdRP 22) \u00d7 (\u2206M 2 ) pr(mAB = 3 \u2223\u03bbP A,\u03bbP B,\u03bbM AB) = 0 when \u03bbPM AB \u2208(RP 22 \ufffdRP 23 \ufffdRP 32 \ufffdRP 33) \u00d7 (\u2206M 3 ) pr(mAB = 4 \u2223\u03bbP A,\u03bbP B,\u03bbM AB) = 0 when \u03bbPM AB \u2208(RP 12 \ufffdRP 23 \ufffdRP 22 \ufffdRP 23) \u00d7 (\u2206M 4 )\n# \u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 ( = \u2223 ) =  \u2208(  \ufffd  \ufffd  \ufffd ) \u00d7 (  ) Observation 2: According to equation (3.13), regardless of which quantum state has been prepared, the sum of the response functions must be equal to one.\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 ( = \u2223 ) =  \u2208(  \ufffd  \ufffd  \ufffd ) \u00d7 (  ) Observation 2: According to equation (3.13), regardless of which quantum state has been prepared, the sum of the response functions must be equal to one.\n\u03a34 i=1pr(mAB = i \u2223\u03bbP A,\u03bbP B,\u03bbM AB)\n=( = \u2223 ) Step 3. Fortunately, there is no contradiction between the implications of the first observation, in (3.32), and the consequences of the second observation, in (3.33): The ontic states \u03bbPM AB = (\u03bbP A,\u03bbP B,\u03bbM AB) in equations of the set (3.32) are not the same. Rather, each triplet belongs to one specific sub-region of the total ontic space which is disjoint from the others. Hence, if the response function of our model assigns zero to one triplet, the other three triplets become non-zero. And exactly these three triplets can reproduce the first observation (3.32). To be precise, different parts of the measurement ontic state space are completely disjoint from each other. So, we have\n(3.31)\n(3.33)\n(3.34)\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f14f/f14f7280-a199-4912-8e20-49c9429c44d0.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 6: An illustration of a specific sub-region of the total ontic state space for PBR\u2019s scenario, namely \u2206P A \u00d7 \u2206P B \u00d7 \u039bM AB. This 3D-representation has been obtained from the Cartesian product of the previous 2D-representations of the preparation and measurement procedures in figures (3) and (4). Clearly, this sub-region is composed of four disjoint parts, each of which being able to reproduce PBR\u2019s statistics without any contradiction. Hence, supports of the ontic state in four equations (3.32) do not share any common ontic state, \u2223(RP 22 \u00d7 \u2206M i ) \u2229(RP 22 \u00d7 \u2206M j\u2260i)\u2223= 0 (3.35)\n\u2223(RP 22 \u00d7 \u2206M i ) \u2229(RP 22 \u00d7 \u2206M j\u2260i)\u2223= 0\n# 4 Conclusion\nFirst, I investigated the PBR theorem and its underlying framework, OMF. Pointing to a problem inside the OMF definition, I defined a modified version of OMF, MOMF. Translating the PBR\u2019s scenario in MOMF, I showed that PBR\u2019s claim in rejecting the epistemic view is not because of the nature of the wavefunction. Rather, (I argued that) the reason of why PBR have found such a result lies in the OMF definition. That this, the PBR theorem has vanished within MOMF. Inserting the measurement ontic state was the key idea of this paper. This analysis suggests that the importance of PBR\u2019s work is not because of their conclusion about the nature of the wavefunction. Rather, PBR\u2019s finding reveals a significant deficiency of OMF in not considering the ontic level of measurement devices. It is important to note that, the arguments of this paper do not lead to any conclusion about the nature of wavefunction. However, the paper reveals that PBR\u2019s arguments cannot reject the epistemic view of the wavefunction.\n# Acknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to Erik Curiel and Neil Dewar for their very careful reviews and comments.
