[10]) refers to the wide family of non-classical propositional logics in which the distributive laws \u03b1 \u2227(\u03b2 \u2228\u03b3) \u22a2(\u03b1 \u2227\u03b2)\u2228(\u03b1 \u2227\u03b3) and (\u03b1 \u2228\u03b2)\u2227(\u03b1 \u2228\u03b3) \u22a2\u03b1 \u2228(\u03b2 \u2227\u03b3) do not need to be valid. Since the rise of very well known instances such as quantum logic [52], interest in nondistributive logics has been building steadily over the years. This interest has been motivated by insights from a range of fields in logic and neighbouring disciplines. Techniques and ideas have come from pure mathematical areas such as lattice theory, duality and representation (cf. [68, 28, 48, 1, 61, 47, 43, 34], and more recently [29, 36, 26, 55, 56, 25, 44, 45, 46]), and areas in mathematical logic such as algebraic proof theory (cf. [5, 32, 11]), but also from the philosophical and formal foundations of quantum physics [8, 38, 10], philosophical logic [63] theoretical computer science and formal linguistics [50, 37, 53]. The present paper discusses an ongoing line of research in the relational (non topological) semantics of non-distributive logics. The developments we will consider are technically rooted in dual characterization results and insights from unified correspondence theory [24, 20, 19]. However, they also have broader, conceptual ramifications for the intuitive meaning of non-distributive logics. Specifically, the slogan from the title, \u2018from semantics to meaning\u2019, intends to convey the idea that, not dissimilarly from the conceptual contribution of Kripke frames to the intuitive understanding of modal logics in various signatures, the relational semantics of non-distributive logics can help to illuminate what these logics are about at a more fundamental and conceptual level than what the technical insights, constraints and desiderata typically yield. For instance, a natural question is whether relational semantics of (some) nondistributive logics can provide an intuitive explanation of why, or under which circumstances, the failure of distributivity is a reasonable and desirable feature; i.e. whether a given relational semantics supports one or more intuitive interpretations under which the failure of distributivity is an essential part of what \u2018correct reasoning patterns\u2019 are in certain specific contexts. Perhaps even more interestingly, whether relational semantics can be used to unambiguously identify those contexts. Such an intuitive explanation\nalso requires a different interpretation of the connectives \u2228and \u2227which coherently fits with the interpretation of the other logical connectives, and which coherently extends to the meaning of axioms in various\ntation of the other logical connectives, and which coherently extends to the meaning of axioms in various signatures. The starting point and background of the present paper is the theory of those non-distributive logics which arise as the logics canonically associated with varieties of normal lattice expansions (cf. Section 2), i.e. algebras based on general lattices with additional connectives of any finite arity, which satisfy certain finite-distributivity properties coordinate-wise. Throughout the paper, these logics will be referred to as normal LE-logics, or just LE-logics. By their definition, LE-logics are presented via their algebraic semantics; however, relational semantics for LE-logics in any signature can be introduced by a process of dual characterization which pivots on well-known adjunctions and representation theorems [7, 61] complete lattices. In Section 4, we illustrate the dual characterization methodology in detail, and apply it to obtain the definitions of two relational semantic frameworks for LE-logics: the polarity-based frames and the graph-based frames. Although polarity-based and graph-based semantics are tightly connected and arise from the application of the same methodology, they give rise to two radically different intuitive interpretations of LE-logics: namely, the polarity-based semantics supports the interpretation of LE-logics as logics of formal concepts (and consequently, of specific LE-signatures such as those of lattice-based normal modal logics as e.g. epistemic logics of categories and concepts); the graph-based semantics supports a view of LE-logics as hyper-constructivist logics, i.e. logics in which the principle of excluded middle fails at the meta-linguistic level (in the sense that, at states in graph-based models, formulas can be satisfied, refuted or neither), and hence their propositional base generalizes intuitionistic logic in the same way in which intuitionistic logic generalizes classical logic. Consequently, we will argue that graph-based semantics supports the interpretation of specific LE-signatures such as those of lattice-based normal modal logics as e.g. epistemic logics of informational entropy). All this is discussed in Section 4. In the present paper, we will only scratch the surface of a broad research program, and hint at the existence of an extremely rich conceptual and technical landscape. Rather than giving an exhaustive survey of the existing results in the relational semantics of non-distributive logic, we focus on: (a) highlighting the methodological aspects involved in the definition of the relational semantics for LE-logics; this methodology can be applied also to different semantics than the ones discussed in the present paper (and it would be very interesting to discover which possibly different interpretations of LE-logics are supported by other semantics), and (b) substantiating the claim that relational semantics for non-distributive logics can bring the same types of benefits that Kripke semantics has brought to modal logic, both from a technical point of view (concerning results such as the finite model property, correspondence theory, transfer results driven by G\u00a8odel-McKinsey-Tarski-style translations, Goldblatt-Thomason-style characterization theorems, semantic cut elimination) and from a conceptual viewpoint, concerning the extent to which these logics are suited to model a range of situations and phenomena. Finally, the picture already emerging from the preliminary account presented in this paper suggests that, similarly to what happens in the case of modal logics, many important results and insights can be obtained in complete uniformity, also across different types of relational semantics, so that various proposals and solutions developed for specific signatures (e.g. Routley-Meyer semantics for substructural logics) can be systematically connected and extended to other signatures.\n# 2 LE-logics\nInformally, LE-logics are the logics of (varieties of) lattice expansions: for disjoint sets of connectives F and G , a lattice expansion (abbreviated as LE) is a tuple A = (L,F A,G A) such that L is a bounded lattice, F A = {f A | f \u2208F} and G A = {gA | g \u2208G }, such that every f A \u2208F A (resp. gA \u2208G A) is an nf-ary (resp. ng-ary) operation on A. We say that an LE is normal if every f A \u2208F A (resp. gA \u2208G A) is coordinatewise either monotone or antitone, and preserves finite (hence also empty) joins (resp. meets)\nin each monotone coordinate and reverses finite (hence also empty) meets (resp. joins) in each antitone coordinate. Henceforth, since every LE is assumed to be normal, the adjective will be dropped. An LE as above is complete if L is a complete lattice, and every f A \u2208F A (resp. gA \u2208G A) preserves arbitrary joins (resp. meets) in each monotone coordinate and reverses arbitrary meets (resp. joins) in each antitone coordinate. For any algebraic LE-signature as above, the set of formulas of the language LLE := LLE(F,G ) over a denumerable set Prop of proposition letters is defined recursively as follows:\n\u03d5 ::= p | \u22a5| \u22a4| \u03d5 \u2227\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2228\u03d5 | f(\u03d5) | g(\u03d5)\nwhere p \u2208Prop, f \u2208F and g \u2208G .\nExample 2.1. The language LBi of bi-intuitionistic logic [62] is obtained by instantiating F := {> } and G := {\u2192}. Both connectives are binary, and are antitone in the first coordinate and monotone in the second one. The language LIL of intuitionistic logic is the {> }-free fragment of LBi. The language LDML of distributive modal logic (cf. [35], [18]) is obtained by letting F := {\u2666,\u22b3} and and G := {\u25a1,\u22b2}; all connectives are unary, and \u2666and \u25a1are monotone while \u22b3and \u22b2negative. The language LPML of positive modal logic [27] is the {\u22b3,\u22b2}-free fragment of LDML. The language LBiML of bi-intuitionistic modal logic [69] is obtained by instantiating F := {> ,\u2666} and G := {\u2192,\u25a1}. The language LIML of intuitionistic modal logic [31] is the {> }-free fragment of LBiML. The language LSDM of semi-De Morgan logic (cf. [65]) coincides with the language of Orthologic [38] and is the {\u2666,\u25a1,\u22b3}-free fragment of LDML. The language LFL of the Full Lambek calculus [51, 32] is obtained by instantiating F := {e,\u25e6} with e nullary and \u25e6binary and monotone in both coordinates, and G := {/\u25e6,\\\u25e6} with /\u25e6(resp. \\\u25e6) binary and monotone in its first (resp. second) coordinate and antitone in its second (resp. first) one. The language LLG of the Lambek-Grishin calculus (cf. [54]) is obtained by letting F := {e,\u25e6,/\u22c6,\\\u22c6} and G := { e ,\u22c6,/\u25e6,\\\u25e6}. Here e is nullary, \u22c6is binary and monotone in both coordinates, and /\u22c6(resp. \\\u22c6) binary and monotone in its first (resp. second) coordinate and antitone in its second (resp. first) one. The language LMALL of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (cf. [32]) is the {\u22c6,/\u22c6,\\\u22c6,/\u25e6}-free fragment of LLG. In what follows, we will mainly focus on LE-signatures the \u2018expansion\u2019 part of which consists of unary connectives, and take them as our running examples throughout the remainder of the paper (see [41, 20] for a treatment of arbitrary signatures). The basic framework is given by the basic normal nondistributive modal logic L := LLDML, defined as the smallest set of sequents \u03d5 \u22a2\u03c8 in the language LDML of distributive modal logic, containing the following axioms:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/1dda/1ddae2dd-8bef-4718-a80a-91ad6b7694e4.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n\u2022 Sequents for modal operators:\nand closed under the following inference rules:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">and closed under the following inference rules:</div>\n\u2666(p\u2228q) \u22a2\u2666p\u2228\u2666q \u22b3(p\u2227q) \u22a2\u22b3p\u2228\u22b3q\n# 3 Polarity-based and graph-based semantics of LE-logics\nIn the present section, we discuss two types of relational semantics for LE-logics, starting with the common methodology used to define them, both for specific LE-signatures [36, 12, 14] and for arbitrary ones [20, 41, 23]. This methodology uses adjunctions involving complete lattices to define the interpretation of LE-formulas on relational structures by \u2018translating\u2019 their interpretation on algebras by means of a dual characterization process on which we expand and exemplify in the next subsection (cf. also discussions in [24, 20]). The resulting semantic environments are those we discuss below and in the appendix.\n# 3.1 Polarities, reflexive graphs and complete lattices\nPolarities and representation of complete lattices. A polarity [33] is a structure P = (A,X,I) such that A and X are sets and I \u2286A\u00d7X is a binary relation. For every polarity P, maps (\u00b7)\u2191: P(A) \u2192P(X) and (\u00b7)\u2193: P(X) \u2192P(A) can be defined as follows: B\u2191:= {x \u2208X | \u2200a \u2208A(a \u2208B \u2192aIx)} and Y \u2193:= {a \u2208A | \u2200x \u2208X(x \u2208Y \u2192aIx)}. The maps (\u00b7)\u2191and (\u00b7)\u2193 form a Galois connection between (P(A),\u2286) and (P(X),\u2286), i.e. Y \u2286B\u2191iff B \u2286Y \u2193for all B \u2208P(A) and Y \u2208P(X). A formal concept of P is a pair c = ([[c]],([c])) such that [[c]] \u2286A, ([c]) \u2286X, and [[c]]\u2191= ([c]) and ([c])\u2193= [[c]]. It follows immediately from this definition that if ([[c]],([c])) is a formal concept, then [[c]]\u2191\u2193= [[c]] and ([c])\u2193\u2191= ([c]), that is [[c]] and ([c]) are Galois-stable. The set L(P) of the formal concepts of P can be partially ordered as follows: for any c,d \u2208L(P),\nc \u2264d iff [[c]] \u2286[[d]] iff ([d]) \u2286([c]).\nWith this order, L(P) is a complete lattice such that, for any X \u2286L(P),\n# With this order, L(P) is a complete lattice such that, for any X \u2286L(P),\n\ufffd X = ( \ufffd {[[c]] | c \u2208X },( \ufffd {[[c]] | c \u2208X })\u2191) \ufffd X = (( \ufffd {([c]) | c \u2208X })\u2193, \ufffd {([c]) | c \u2208X }).\nThis complete lattice is referred to as the concept lattice P+ of P. Moreover,\nProposition 3.1. For any polarity P = (A,X,I), the complete lattice P+ is completely join-generated by the set {a := (a\u2191\u2193,a\u2191) | a \u2208A} and is completely meet-generated by the set {x := (x\u2193,x\u2193\u2191) | x \u2208X}.\nProposition 3.1. For any polarity P = (A,X,I), the complete lattice Pis completely join-generated by the set {a := (a\u2191\u2193,a\u2191) | a \u2208A} and is completely meet-generated by the set {x := (x\u2193,x\u2193\u2191) | x \u2208X}. Proof. Every formal concept is both of the form c = (Y \u2193,Y \u2193\u2191) for some Y \u2286X and of the form c = (B\u2191\u2193,B\u2191) for some B \u2286A. Since Y = \ufffd{x | x \u2208Y} and B = \ufffd{a | a \u2208B}, and (\u00b7)\u2193: P(X) \u2192P(A) and (\u00b7)\u2191: P(A) \u2192P(X), being Galois-adjoint, are completely join-reversing, [[c]] =Y \u2193= \ufffd{[[x]] | x \u2208Y} = [[\ufffd{x | x \u2208Y}]] and [[c]] = B\u2191\u2193= (\ufffd{([a]) | a \u2208B})\u2193= [[\ufffd{a | a \u2208B}]], as required.\nProof. Every formal concept is both of the form c = (Y \u2193,Y \u2193\u2191) for some Y \u2286X and of the form c = (B\u2191\u2193,B\u2191) for some B \u2286A. Since Y = \ufffd{x | x \u2208Y} and B = \ufffd{a | a \u2208B}, and (\u00b7)\u2193: P(X) \u2192P(A) and (\u00b7)\u2191: P(A) \u2192P(X), being Galois-adjoint, are completely join-reversing, [[c]] =Y \u2193= \ufffd{[[x]] | x \u2208Y} = [[\ufffd{x | x \u2208Y}]] and [[c]] = B\u2191\u2193= (\ufffd{([a]) | a \u2208B})\u2193= [[\ufffd{a | a \u2208B}]], as required.\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd The following theorem is a converse to the proposition above.1\nTheorem 3.2 (Birkhoff\u2019s representation theorem). Any complete lattice L is isomorphic to the concep lattice P+ of some polarity P.\nProof. Let P := (L,L,\u2264), where L is the domain of L and \u2264is the lattice order. Then it is easy to see that the formal concepts of P are of the form ((\ufffdX)\u2193,(\ufffdX)\u2191) for any X \u2286L, and since L is complete, the assignments a \ufffd\u2192(a\u2193,a\u2191) and ((\ufffdX)\u2193,(\ufffdX)\u2191) \ufffd\u2192\ufffdX define a pair of order isomorphisms between L and P+. 1For every partial order (X,\u2264) and every x \u2208X, we let x\u2191:= {y \u2208X | x \u2264y} and x\u2193:= {y \u2208X | y \u2264x}.\nProof. Let P := (L,L,\u2264), where L is the domain of L and \u2264is the lattice order. Then it is easy to see that the formal concepts of P are of the form ((\ufffdX)\u2193,(\ufffdX)\u2191) for any X \u2286L, and since L is complete, the assignments a \ufffd\u2192(a\u2193,a\u2191) and ((\ufffdX)\u2193,(\ufffdX)\u2191) \ufffd\u2192\ufffdX define a pair of order isomorphisms between L and P+.\nProof. Let P := (L,L,\u2264), where L is the domain of L and \u2264is the lattice order. Then it is easy to see that the formal concepts of P are of the form ((\ufffdX)\u2193,(\ufffdX)\u2191) for any X \u2286L, and since L is complete, the assignments a \ufffd\u2192(a\u2193,a\u2191) and ((\ufffdX)\u2193,(\ufffdX)\u2191) \ufffd\u2192\ufffdX define a pair of order isomorphisms between L and P+.\nReflexive graphs and representation of complete lattices. A reflexive graph is a structure X = (Z,E) such that Z is a nonempty set, and E \u2286Z \u00d7Z is a reflexive relation, i.e. \u2206\u2286E, where \u2206:= {(z,z) | z \u2208Z}. From now on, we will assume that all graphs we consider are reflexive even when we drop the adjective. Any graph X = (Z,E) defines the polarity PX = (ZA,ZX,IEc) where ZA = Z = ZX and IEc \u2286ZA \u00d7 ZX is defined as aIEcx iff aEcx iff (a,x) /\u2208E. The complete lattice X+ associated with a graph X is defined as the concept lattice of PX. Conversely, for any lattice L, let Flt(L) and Idl(L) denote the set of filters and ideals of L, respectively. The graph associated with L is XL := (Z,E) where Z is the set of tuples (F,J) \u2208Flt(L)\u00d7Idl(L) such that F \u2229J = \u2205. For z \u2208Z, we denote by Fz the filter part of z and by Jz the ideal part of z. Clearly, filter parts and ideal parts of states of XL must be proper. The (reflexive) E relation is defined by zEz\u2032 if and only if Fz \u2229Jz\u2032 = \u2205.\n# 3.2 From algebraic to relational semantics\nIn the present subsection, we discuss how the adjunctions outlined in the previous subsection can be used to define an interpretation of the propositional language of general lattices on polarities and reflexive graphs, starting from the standard interpretation of this logic on complete lattices. The same method will be applied to define polarity-based and graph-based semantics for any LE-language LLE = LLE(F,G ) from complete LLE-algebras, via the adjunctions above, suitably expanded to account for the interpretation of the additional connectives, in a uniform and modular way. This method stems from the observation that interpretations on complex algebras and satisfaction relations on frames correspond to one another along the adjunctions outlined above. Let L be the propositional language of the logic of general lattices. In what follows we will abuse notation and identify the logic with its language. Let us briefly recall how the correspondence between interpretations on complex algebras and satisfaction relations on frames works in the Boolean and distributive settings. In the Boolean and distributive settings, for any partially ordered set F = (W,\u2264) (in the Boolean case, \u2264coincides with the identity \u2206W), and any satisfaction relation \u22a9\u2286W \u00d7 L between elements of F and formulas, an interpretation v : L \u2192F+ can be defined2, which is a lattice homomorphism, and is obtained as the unique homomorphic extension of the equivalent functional representation of the relation \u22a9as a map v : Prop \u2192F+, defined as v(p) = \u22a9\u22121[p]3. In this way, interpretations on complete lattices can be derived from satisfaction relations, so that for every w \u2208W and every L-formula \u03d5,\nw \u22a9\u03d5 iff w \u2264v(\u03d5),\n# w \u22a9\u03d5 iff w \u2264v(\u03d5),\nwhere, on the right-hand side, w \u2208J\u221e(F+) is the completely join-irreducible element4 of F+ arising from w \u2208W. Conversely, for any such F, any lattice homomorphism v : L \u2192F+ gives rise to a satisfaction relation \u22a9\u2286W \u00d7L defined as in (1). Instantiating condition (1) according to the syntactic shape of each formula in L, we obtain the familiar satisfaction conditions of L-formulas in the distributive setting; for instance, the satisfaction clause of \u2228-formulas can be obtained as follows:\n\u22a9\u03d5 \u2228\u03c8 iff w \u2264v(\u03d5 \u2228\u03c8) definition of \u22a9as in (1) iff w \u2264v(\u03d5)\u2228v(\u03c8) v is a homomorphism iff w \u2264v(\u03d5) or w \u2264v(\u03c8) w \u2208J\u221e(F+) and F+ distributive iff w \u22a9\u03d5 or w \u22a9\u03c8 (1) on \u03d5 and \u03c8 by induction hypothesis.\n2In the Boolean setting, F+ is the powerset algebra P(W); in the distributive setting, F+ is the algebra P\u2191(W) of the upward-closed subsets of F. 3Notice that in order for this equivalent functional representation to be well defined, we need to assume that the relation \u22a9is F+-compatible, i.e. that \u22a9\u22121[p] \u2208F+ for every p \u2208Prop. In the Boolean case, every relation from W to L is clearly F+-compatible, but already in the distributive case this is not so: indeed \u22a9\u22121[p] needs to be an upward- or downward-closed subset of F. This gives rise to the persistence condition, e.g. in the relational semantics of intuitionistic logic. 4In the Boolean setting, w := {w}; in the distributive setting, w := w\u2191= {w\u2032 \u2208W | w \u2264w\u2032}.\n(1)\nTo define an interpretation of L on polarities and reflexive graphs, we are going to apply the homomorphism to-relation direction of the argument illustrated above. That is, for an arbitrary polarity P = (A,X,I) any homomorphic assignment v : L \u2192P+ will give rise to pairs of relations (\u22a9,\u227b) such that \u22a9\u2286A\u00d7L and \u227b\u2286X \u00d7L, so that for every a \u2208A and x \u2208X, and every L-formula \u03d5,\nx \u227b\u03d5 iff v(\u03d5) \u2264x,\nwhere, on the right-hand side of the equivalences above, a = (a\u2191\u2193,a\u2191) \u2208P+ and x = (x\u2193,x\u2193\u2191) \u2208P+.

Starting from complete LLE-algebras, we will translate homomorphic assignments of LLE-formulas into relations \u22a9and \u227bvia suitable expansions of the adjunctions between complete lattices and polarities and (complete) lattices and reflexive graphs. Let us first recall how the usual satisfaction relation clauses can be retrieved from the algebraic interpretation in the Boolean and distributive case for a unary diamond \u2666. Let ML be the propositional language of the logic of general lattices expanded with a unary and positive f-type connective \u2666. In what follows, we will abuse notation and identify the minimal normal ML-logic with its language. Let W = (W,\u2264) be a partially ordered set (in the Boolean case, \u2264coincides with the identity \u2206W), and let us expand W+ with a completely join-preserving unary operation \u2666W+ so as to obtain a (Boolean or distributive) modal algebra A = (W+,\u2666W+). Let v : ML \u2192A be a homomorphic assignment, hence v(\u2666\u03d5) = \u2666W+v(\u03d5). As done in the previous subsection, the recursive definition of the relation \u22a9\u2286W \u00d7ML corresponding to the assignment v is obtained by spelling out equation (1). For the case of \u2666-formulas, since W+ is a perfect5 distributive lattice and v(\u2666\u03c8) \u2208W+, we get v(\u03c8) = \ufffd{w\u2032 \u2208J\u221e(W+) | w\u2032 \u2264v(\u03c8)} = \ufffd{w\u2032 \u2208J\u221e(W+) | w\u2032 \u22a9\u03c8}. Since by assumption v is a homomorphism, v(\u2666\u03c8) = \u2666W+v(\u03c8) = \u2666W+(\ufffd{w\u2032 \u2208J\u221e(W+) | w\u2032 \u22a9\u03c8}), and since \u2666W+ is completely join-preserving, we get:\nHence, for any w \u2208W,\n5A complete lattice A is perfect if it is both completely join-generated by the set J\u221e(A) of its completely join-irreducible elements, and completely meet-generated by the set M\u221e(A) of its completely meet-irreducible elements.\nmplete lattice A is perfect if it is both completely join-generated by the set J\u221e(A) of its completely join-irreducible and completely meet-generated by the set M\u221e(A) of its completely meet-irreducible elements.\nw \u22a9\u2666\u03c8 iff w \u2264v(\u2666\u03c8) iff w \u2264\ufffd{\u2666W+w\u2032 | w\u2032 \u22a9\u03c8} iff w \u2264\u2666W+w\u2032 for some w\u2032 \u2208W s.t. w\u2032 \u22a9\u03c8 (w completely join-prime) iff wR\u2666w\u2032 for some w\u2032 \u2208W s.t. w\u2032 \u22a9\u03c8.\nSo we have done two things at the same time: Firstly, we have defined the accessibility relation R\u2666\u2286 W \u00d7W corresponding to the interpretation of \u2666as \u2666W+ as follows:\nwR\u2666w\u2032 iff w \u2264\u2666W+w\u2032.\nSecondly, we have derived the corresponding defining clause for \u2666-formulas. The same can be done in the general lattice case, starting e.g. from a polarity P = (A,X,I) and expanding P+ with a completely join preserving unary operation \u2666P+ so as to obtain a lattice-based complete modal algebra A = (P+,\u2666P+). Analogously to the way we argued above and appealing to Proposition 3.1, we can write v(\u03c8) = \ufffd{a \u2208P+ | a \u2264v(\u03c8)} = \ufffd{a \u2208P+ | a \u22a9\u03c8}. Since by assumption v is a homomorphism, v(\u2666\u03c8) = \u2666P+v(\u03c8) = \u2666P+(\ufffd{a \u2208P+ | a \u22a9\u03c8}), and since \u2666P+ is completely join-preserving, we get:\n\ufffd However, the chain of equivalences above breaks down in the third step, since the elements a are not in general completely join-prime anymore, but only complete join-generators (cf. Proposition 3.1). However, we can obtain a reduction also in this case, by crucially making use of the completely meetgenerating elements x:\nwhere we have defined the accessibility relation R\u2666\u2286X \u00d7A corresponding to the interpretation of \u2666 \u2666P+ as follows: xR\u2666a iff \u2666P+a \u2264x.

For ease of presentation we address this issue in the signature of LPML. Algebraically, the polarity-based and graph-based structures F that can be recognized as \u201cclassical\u201d are exactly those the complex algebra F+ of which is (isomorphic to) a powerset algebra (possibly endowed with extra operations). This is the case of structures based on graphs X = (Z,E) such that E = \u2206, or based on polarities P = (A,X,I) such that A = X = Z for some set Z, and aIx iff a \u0338= x for all a,x \u2208Z. In these cases, the powerset algebra P(Z) can be represented as a concept lattice each element of which is of the form (Y,Y c) for any Y \u2286Z. Therefore, for any formula \u03d5 interpreted in these structures, ([\u03d5]) = {z \u2208Z | z \u227b\u03d5} = [[\u03d5]]c, and hence z \u227b\u03d5 iff z \u0338\u22a9\u03d5. This of course provides a more direct way to reduce \u227bto \u22a9than the one defined in terms of the operations (\u00b7)\u2191and (\u00b7)\u2193, which allows to formulate the well known recursive definition of satisfaction in the classical setting purely in terms of \u22a9. In particular, the satisfaction clause for \u2228-formulas on the \u201cclassical\u201d polarity-based models described above can be rewritten as follows: for any a \u2208Z and all formulas \u03d5 and \u03c8,\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4aa2/4aa2330f-8e2f-44b2-a659-cb71f49717d9.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\na \u22a9\u22a5 iff a \u0338\u227b\u22a5 which is never the case.\nAs for the interpretation of \u2666-formulas, if JRc \u2666\u2286X \u00d7A is the corresponding relation on the given \u201cclas sical\u201d polarity-based models as described above, applying the following clause x \u227b\u2666\u03c8 iff for all a \u2208A, if a \u22a9\u03c8 then xJRc \u2666a\nyields\nx \u22a9\u2666\u03c8 iff x \u0338\u227b\u2666\u03c8 iff for some a \u2208A, a \u22a9\u03c8 and (x,a) /\u2208JRc \u2666 iff for some a \u2208A, a \u22a9\u03c8 and xR\u2666a.\nwhere xJRc \u2666a iff (x,a) /\u2208R\u2666for every x,a \u2208Z. As for the interpretation of \u25a1-formulas, stipulating likewise, that aIRc \u25a1x iff (a,x) /\u2208R\u25a1for every x,a \u2208Z, the satisfaction clause for \u25a1-formulas can b rewritten as follows:\n\u03d5 iff for all x \u2208X, if x \u227b\u03d5 then aIRc \u25a1x iff for all x \u2208X, if x \u0338\u22a9\u03d5 then (a,x) /\u2208R\u25a1 iff for all x \u2208X, if aR\u25a1x then x \u22a9\u03d5.\nSimilar computations show that also in the setting of the graph-based semantics, the satisfaction and refutation clauses project to the well known ones. For instance, when zEz\u2032 iff z = z\u2032 and z \u227b\u03d5 iff z \u0338\u22a9\u03d5,\nz \u22a9\u03d5 \u2228\u03c8 iff for all z\u2032 \u2208Z, if zEz\u2032 then z\u2032 \u0338\u227b\u03d5 or z\u2032 \u0338\u227b\u03c8 iff for all z\u2032 \u2208Z, if z = z\u2032 then z\u2032 \u22a9\u03d5 or z\u2032 \u22a9\u03c8 iff z \u22a9\u03d5 or z \u22a9\u03c8. Analogously, the following clause\n# z \u227b\u2666\u03d5 iff for all z\u2032, if zR\u2666z\u2032 then z\u2032 \u0338\u22a9\u03d5\nyields\nz \u22a9\u2666\u03d5 iff z \u0338\u227b\u2666\u03d5 iff for some z\u2032, zR\u2666z\u2032 and z\u2032 \u22a9\u03d5.\nThe remaining computations are omitted. In conclusion, in the present section we have discussed a uniform methodology for defining relational semantics for normal LE-logics in any signature on the basis of their standard interpretation on complete LE-algebras of compatible signature. We have concretely illustrated how this methodology works in the case of two different semantic environments, and we have discussed how these environments project onto the Kripke semantics of classical normal modal logic. However, in order for these environments to \u2018make sense\u2019 in a more fundamental way, we need to couple them with extra-mathematical interpretations which simultaneously account for the meaning of all connectives, and which coherently extend to the meaning of logical axioms and of their first-order correspondents. In the next section, we discuss two possible interpretations, and the views on LE-logics elicited by each of them.\n# 4 From semantics to meaning\nAny extra-mathematical interpretation of LE-logics must account for the failure of distributivity. Although, as discussed in the previous section, polarity-based and graph-based semantic structures arise from the standard interpretation in LE-algebras via the same dual-characterization methodology, they give rise to two radically different views on what LE-logics are and mean. The key difference lies in a dichotomy between two interpretive strategies, each of which identifies different sources of nondistributivity. The first such strategy, supported by the polarity-based semantics, drops the interpretation of \u2227and \u2228as conjunction and disjunction in natural language and stipulates that LE-formulas do not denote sentences describing states of affairs, but rather objects with a different ontology, such as categories, concepts, questions, theories, to which a truth value might not necessarily be applicable. The second interpretive strategy is supported by the graph based semantics and retains the sentential denotation of formulas in the context of a propositional logic which can be thought of as a kind of \u2018hyper-constructivism\u2019.\n# 4.1 LE-logics as logics of formal concepts, categories,\n# 4.1 LE-logics as logics of formal concepts, categories, theories, interrogative agendas...\nPolarities as abstract databases. The idea that lattices are the proper mathematical environment for discussing \u201cespecially systems which are in any sense hierarchies\u201d goes back to Birkhoff [6]. Based on this idea, Wille [33] and his collaborators developed Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as a theory in information science aimed at the formal representation and analysis of conceptual structures, which has been applied to a wide range of fields ranging from psychology, sociology and linguistics to biology and chemistry.\nBuilding on philosophical insights developed by the school of Port-Royal [2], Wille specified concepts in terms of their extension, i.e. the set of objects which exemplify the given concept, and their intension, i.e. the set of attributes shared by the objects in the extension of the given concept, and identified Birkhoff\u2019s polarities P = (A,X,I) (cf. Section 3.1), also referred to as formal contexts, as the appropriate mathematical environment in which to formally represent these ideas: indeed, a polarity P as above can be understood as an abstract representation of a database, recording information about a given set A of objects (relevant to a given context or situation), and a set X of relevant attributes or features. In this representation, the (incidence) relation I \u2286A\u00d7X encodes whether object a \u2208A has feature x \u2208X as aIx. The Galois-adjoint pair of maps (\u00b7)\u2191: P(A) \u2192P(X) and (\u00b7)\u2193: P(X) \u2192P(A) can be understood as concept-generating maps: namely, as maps taking any set B of objects to the intension B\u2191which uniquely determines the formal concept (B\u2191\u2193,B\u2191) generated by B, and any set Y of attributes to the extension Y \u2193which uniquely determines the formal concept (Y \u2193,Y \u2193\u2191) generated by Y. Hence, the philosophical and cognitive insight that concepts do not occur in isolation, but rather arise within a hierarchy of other concepts, finds a very natural representation in the construction of the complete lattice P+ and its natural order as the sub-concept relation. Indeed, a subconcept of a given concept, understood as a more restrictive concept, will have a smaller extension (i.e. fewer examples) and a larger intension (i.e. a larger set of requirements that objects need to satisfy in order to count as examples of the given sub-concept). This interpretation accounts for the failure of distributivity, as we will concretely illustrate below.\nPropositional lattice logic as the basic logic of formal concepts. Imposing the FCA interpretation of polarities discussed above on the polarity-based semantics of the logic L (Section 3.2) yields an interpretation of L-formulas as terms (i.e. names) denoting formal concepts. Starting from assignments to proposition variables, any L-formula \u03d5 is then interpreted on a given polarity P = (A,X,I) as a formal concept ([[\u03d5]],([\u03d5])) \u2208P+; specifically, for each object a \u2208A and feature x \u2208X, the relations a \u22a9\u03d5 and x \u227b\u03d5 can be respectively understood as \u2018object a is a member of (or exemplifies) concept \u03d5\u2019 and \u2018feature x describes concept \u03d5\u2019, in the sense that x is a required attribute of every example/member of \u03d5. Accordingly, this reading suggests that \u03d5 \u2227\u03c8 can be understood as \u2018the greatest (i.e. least restrictive) common subconcept of concept \u03d5 and concept \u03c8\u2019, i.e. the concept the extension of which is the intersection of the extensions of \u03d5 and \u03c8. Similarly, \u03d5 \u2228\u03c8 is \u2018the least (i.e. most restrictive) common superconcept of concept \u03d5 and concept \u03c8\u2019, i.e. the concept the intension of which is the intersection of the intensions of \u03d5 and \u03c8; the constant \u22a4can be understood as the most generic (or comprehensive) concept (i.e. the one that, when interpreted in any given polarity P as above, allows all objects a \u2208A as examples) while \u22a5 as the most restrictive (i.e. the one that, when interpreted in any given polarity P as above, requires its examples to have all attributes x \u2208X). Finally, \u03d5 \u22a2\u03c8 can be understood as the statement that \u2018concept \u03d5 is a sub-concept of concept \u03c8\u2019. As mentioned above, this interpretation accounts for the failure of distributivity. Indeed, objects in the extension of concept \u03d5 \u2228\u03c8 are only required to have all attributes common to the intentions of concepts \u03d5 and \u03c8; this weaker requirement potentially allows objects in [[\u03d5 \u2228\u03c8]] which belong to neither [[\u03d5]] nor to [[\u03c8]]. To illustrate this point concretely, consider the \u2018database\u2019 of theatrical plays P = (A,X,I) the set of objects of which is A := {a,b,c}, where a is A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, b is King Lear, and c is Julius Caesar, while its set of features is X := {x,y,z}, where x is \u2018no happy end\u2019, y is \u2018some characters are real historical figures\u2019, and z is \u2018two characters fall in love with each other\u2019. The following picture represents P and its associated concept lattice.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/c621/c621fbc0-624a-44cc-b5b3-decd1e594371.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nConsider the atomic concept-variables r,d,h where r stands for \u2018romantic comedy\u2019, d for \u2018drama\u2019 and h for \u2018historical drama\u2019. Consider the assignment into P+ which maps r to (a,z), d to (bc,x) and h to (c,yz). Notice that b \u2208[[h\u2228r]] = [[\u22a4]] even though b /\u2208[[h]] \u222a[[r]]. Accordingly, under this assignment, h\u2228r is interpreted as the top element of the concept lattice. The concept d \u2227r is interpreted as the bottom element and, as historical drama is a subgenre of drama, d \u2227h coincides with h. Hence (d \u2227h)\u2228(d \u2227r) coincides with h while d \u2227(h\u2228r) coincides with d. Thus distribution of \u2227over \u2228fails. Dually, objects in the extension of concept \u03d5 \u2227\u03c8 might have more attributes in common than those in ([\u03d5]) \u222a([\u03c8]); for instance in the example above, r \u2227d is the concept (\u2205,xyz) which requires feature y which is neither required by r nor by d; hence h \u2228(r \u2227d) coincides with h, while (h \u2228d) \u2227(h \u2228r) coincides with d, witnessing the failure of \u2228over \u2227also.\nLattice-based normal modal logic as an epistemic logic of formal concepts. So far, we have discussed how the polarity-based semantics of propositional lattice logic L allows for an interpretation of L-formulas as names of formal concepts, and for a coherent interpretation of the meaning of all propositional lattice connectives in a way that makes the failure of distributivity a desirable feature rather than an awkward issue. Next, based on [16, 17], we discuss a first way in which this interpretation can be extended also to the modal connectives. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the minimal normal LE-logic L\u25a1, in the language specified according to the notation of Section 2 by instantiating F := \u2205and G := {\u25a1}, with \u25a1unary and monotone. In what follows, we will abuse notation and identify L\u25a1with its language. As discussed in Section 3.3, this logic can be interpreted on relational structures F = (P,R\u25a1) such that P = (A,X,I) is a polarity, and R\u25a1\u2286A \u00d7 X is a (compatible, see Definition A.1) relation such that, for any assignment v : Prop \u2192P+, corresponding relations \u22a9\u2286A \u00d7 L\u25a1and \u227b\u2286X \u00d7 L\u25a1can be defined. In the case of \u25a1-formulas, this yields\na \u22a9\u25a1\u03d5 iff for all x \u2208X, if x \u227b\u03d5 then aR\u25a1x x \u227b\u25a1\u03d5 iff for all a \u2208A, if a \u22a9\u25a1\u03d5 then aIx.\nBuilding on the understanding of polarities as abstract representation of databases, the relational structures F = (P,R\u25a1) can be understood as (abstract representations of) enriched databases which, together with objective information about objects and their features encoded in the incidence relation I of P, encode also subjective information regarding whether given objects have given attributes according to a given agent; this understanding allows us to read aR\u25a1x as \u2018object a has attribute x according to agent i. Of course, this interpretation can be further specialized so as to represent agents\u2019 knowledge (aR\u25a1x iff \u2018agent i knows that object a has attribute x\u2019), beliefs (aR\u25a1x iff \u2018agent i believes that object a has attribute x\u2019), perceptions (aR\u25a1x iff \u2018agent i sees that object a has attribute x\u2019), evidential reasoning (aR\u25a1x iff \u2018agent i has evidence that object a has attribute x\u2019), and so on. Each of these epistemic interpretations will give rise to a different epistemic reading of \u25a1\u03d5 as \u2018concept \u03d5 according to the given agent i\u2019: namely, \u2018concept \u03d5 as is known/believed/perceived/experienced by agent i\u2019. Also in the case of L\u25a1-formulas, for every object a and attribute x, the symbols a \u22a9\u25a1\u03d5 and x \u227b\u25a1\u03d5 can be understood as \u2018object a is a member/example of \u25a1\u03d5\u2019 and \u2018attribute x describes \u25a1\u03d5\u2019, respectively. Interestingly, the condition that a \u22a9\u25a1\u03d5 iff for all x \u2208X, if x \u227b\u03d5 then aR\u25a1x\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/79f2/79f2b320-de03-4e0a-baf2-7e1b3ef40a0e.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\ncan then be informally understood as saying that any object a is a member/example of concept \u03d5 according to agent i if and only if agent i attributes to a all the defining features of concept \u03d5. This reading is indeed coherent with our informal understanding of which objects should count as members of \u2018concept \u03d5 according to agent i\u2019. Finally, one would also expect that the different variants of epistemic interpretations would satisfy different axioms; for instance, if \u25a1\u03d5 is interpreted as \u2018concept \u03d5 as is known by agent i\u2019, one would ask whether there is some L\u25a1-axioms which would encode the counterparts, in the lattice-based setting, of well known classical epistemic principles such as the factivity condition which distinguishes knowledge from belief, and what would this condition look like in the context of polarity-based relational structures. As is well known, in the setting of classical normal modal logic, factivity is formalized as the modal axiom \u25a1\u03d5 \u2192\u03d5 (which reads \u2018if agent i knows that \u03d5, then \u03d5 is indeed the case\u2019). Moreover, this is a Sahlqvist formula and corresponds on Kripke frames (W,R) to reflexivity or, equivalently, \u2206\u2286R. Since L\u25a1is not sentential, the closest approximation to the classical formula \u25a1\u03d5 \u2192\u03d5 is the L\u25a1-sequent \u25a1\u03d5 \u22a2\u03d5, which turns out (cf. [15, Proposition 4.3]) to correspond on polarity-based structures F as above to the first-order condition R\u25a1\u2286I. That is, for every object a and feature x, if aR\u25a1x (i.e. if a is endowed with x according to agent i) then aIx (i.e. object a indeed has feature x). This condition is arguably an appropriate rendering of factivity in the setting of polarity-based relational structures, which suggests that more modal epistemic principles might retain their intended interpretation even under a substantial generalization step such as the one from the classical (i.e. Boolean) to the latticebased setting. Indeed, this is also the case for positive introspection, which in the language of classical modal logic is formalized as \u25a1\u03d5 \u2192\u25a1\u25a1\u03d5 (which reads \u2018if agent i knows that \u03d5, then agent i knows that she knows \u03d5\u2019). As is well known, this axiom is a Sahlqvist formula the first-order correspondent of which on Kripke frames (W,R) is the condition R \u25e6R \u2286R, namely that the relation R is transitive. Again, the L\u25a1-sequent \u25a1\u25a1\u03d5 \u22a2\u25a1\u03d5 turns out (cf. [15, Proposition 4.3]) to correspond on polarity-based structures F to the first-order condition6 that reads: for every object a and feature x, if agent i thinks that a has feature x, then (agent i must recognize a as an example of what i understands as an x-object, i.e. as a member of i\u2019s understanding of the formal context generated by feature x, and hence) agent i must attribute to a also all the features that, according to i, are shared by all x-objects. As in the case of factivity, one can argue that this condition is an appropriate rendering of the principle of positive introspection in the setting of polarity-based relational structures, since is clearly an internal coherence requirement which seeks to justify any given attribution of a feature to an object by linking it to the wider context of those (other) features that are consequences of the given attribution. Lastly, the notion of omniscience, stipulating that the agent knows everything that is the case, is classically captured by the axiom p \u2192\u25a1p corresponding on Kripke frames to the first-order condition R \u2286\u2206. On polarity-based structures F, the L\u25a1-sequent \u03d5 \u22a2\u25a1\u03d5 (cf. [15, Proposition 4.3]) corresponds to the first-order condition I \u2286R\u25a1, indicating that, whenever an object has a feature, the agent knows this.\nLattice-based normal modal logic as the logic of rough concepts. As discussed above, the interpretation of L\u25a1as an epistemic logic of formal concepts, facilitated by the polarity-based semantics, extends coherently from the informal meaning of the defining clauses of \u22a9and \u227bw.r.t. to \u25a1-formulas, all the way to the preservation of the meaning of well known epistemic principles. However, the epistemic interpretation is not the only possible one; in what follows, we give pointers to another family of possible interpretations, proposed in [15], where polarity-based relational structures for the languages LPML and LDML (cf. Example 2.1) are used to generalize Rough Set Theory (RST) [60] to the setting of rough concepts. The basic models in RST are pairs (X,R), called approximation spaces, with X a non-empty set and R an equivalence relation on X. The set X is to be thought of as the domain of discourse and R as an indiscernibility relation. The equivalence classes of R establish the granularity of the discourse\n6With the aid of the notation ;I for relational composition modulo the polarity relation I (cf. [15, Section 3.4] for the fu definition) this condition can be succinctly captured as R\u25a1\u2286R\u25a1;I R\u25a1.\nby setting the limits to the distinctions that can be drawn. This granularity is captured algebraically by the upper and lower approximation operators arising from approximation spaces, which, when applied to any given subset T \u2286X, encode the available information about T as follows. The lower approximation of T of T consists of those elements whose R-equivalence classes are contained in T, while the upper approximation of T consists of those elements whose R-equivalence classes have non-empty intersection with T. In other words,\n# T := \ufffd {R[z] | z \u2208T and R[z] \u2286T} and T := \ufffd {R[z] | z \u2208T}.\nThe lower approximation T can be thought of as the set of all objects that are definitely in T, while the upper approximation T consists of those objects that are possibly in T. As the reader would have remarked, an approximation space is nothing but a frame for the modal logic S5, and the lower and upper approximation of T \u2286S are obtained by applying the interior and closure operators given by the S5 box and diamond, respectively. This connection with modal logic has indeed not gone unnoticed in the literature and has been elaborated in e.g. [58], [4] and [59]. In [15], conceptual approximation spaces were defined as polarity-based LPML-structures F = (P,R\u25a1,R such that P = (A,X,I) is a polarity, and R\u25a1\u2286A\u00d7X and R\u2666\u2286X \u00d7A are (compatible, see Definition A.1) relations verifying the first-order conditions corresponding to the following modal axioms: \u25a1\u03d5 \u22a2\u2666\u03d5 (seriality)7; \u25a1\u03d5 \u22a2\u03d5 and \u03d5 \u22a2\u2666\u03d5 (reflexivity); \u25a1\u03d5 \u22a2\u25a1\u25a1\u03d5 and \u2666\u2666\u03d5 \u22a2\u2666\u03d5 (transitivity); \u03d5 \u22a2\u25a1\u2666\u03d5 and \u2666\u25a1\u03d5 \u22a2\u03d5 (symmetry). Taken together, these conditions guarantee that F+ := (P,[R\u25a1],\u27e8R\u2666\u27e9) is a complete lattice-based algebra such that [R\u25a1] and \u27e8R\u2666\u27e9are an interior and a closure operator respectively; moreover, \u27e8R\u2666\u27e9is the left adjoint of [R\u25a1] (i.e. aR\u25a1x iff xR\u2666a for every a \u2208A and x \u2208X). Under the usual interpretation of P = (A,X,I) as a database, one possible way to understand aR\u25a1x or equivalently xR\u2666a is \u2018there is evidence that object a has feature x\u2019, or \u2018object a demonstrably has feature x\u2019 (cf. [15, Section 5.1]). This intuitive understanding makes it plausible to assume that R\u25a1\u2286I. Recall that that \u22a9for \u25a1-formulas and of \u227bfor \u2666-formulas (cf. discussion in Section 3.3) were defined as follows:\na \u22a9\u25a1\u03d5 iff for all x \u2208X, if x \u227b\u03d5 then aR\u25a1x x \u227b\u2666\u03d5 iff for all a \u2208A, if a \u22a9\u03d5 then xR\u2666a.\nUnder the interpretation discussed above, these clauses can be understood as saying that \u25a1\u03d5 is the concept the examples/members of which are exactly those objects that demonstrably have all the features shared by \u03d5-objects, and that \u2666\u03d5 is the concept described by the features which all \u03d5-objects demonstrably have. Hence, \u25a1\u03d5 can be understood as the (sub)concept of the certified members of \u03d5, while \u2666\u03d5 as the (super) concept of the potential members of \u03d5. Thus, under the interpretation of R\u25a1and R\u2666proposed above, the polarity-based semantics of LPML supports the understanding of \u25a1\u03d5 and \u2666\u03d5 as the lower and upper approximations of concept \u03d5, respectively. Notice that, while in approximation spaces the relation R relates indiscernible states, and thus directly encodes the extent of our ignorance, in the setting of conceptual approximation spaces, R\u25a1(or equivalently R\u2666) directly encode the (possibly partial) extent of our knowledge or information.\nFrom concepts to other ontologies. In [15], other more specific interpretations are proposed concerning situations which span from the analysis of text databases to medical diagnoses and the analysis of markets. Accordingly, in each of these situations, \u25a1\u03d5 and \u2666\u03d5 can be given more specific interpretations as lower and upper approximations of concepts or categories or relevant clusters. For instance (cf. [15, Section 5.4,] modified), text databases can be modelled as polarity-based LPMLstructures F = (P,R\u25a1,R\u2666) such that P = (A,X,I) with A being a set of documents, X a set of words, and 7In the presence of reflexivity, seriality becomes redundant; however, for the sake of making the generalization more mod-\n7In the presence of reflexivity, seriality becomes redundant; however, for the sake of making the generalization more mod ular, in [15] the basic framework of conceptual approximation spaces only requires seriality.\naIx being understood as \u2018document a has word x as a keyword\u2019. Formal concepts arising from such an F can be understood as themes or topics, intensionally described by Galois-stable sets of (key)words. In this situation, one of the many possible interpretations of aR\u25a1x or equivalently xR\u2666a is \u2018document a has word x as its first or second keyword\u2019, which again makes it plausible to assume that R\u25a1\u2286I. As another example (cf. [15, Section 5.5] modified), let P = (A,X,I) represent a hospital, where A is the set of patients, X is the set of symptoms, and aIx iff \u201cpatient a has symptom x\u201d. Concepts arising from this representation are syndromes, intensionally described by Galois-stable sets of symptoms. In this situation, let aR\u25a1x, or equivalently xR\u2666a, iff \u2018a has been tested for symptom x with positive outcome\u2019. As a third example (cf. [15, Section 5.8] modified), let P = (A,X,I) where A is the set of consumers, X is the set of market-products, and aIx iff \u2018consumer a buys product x\u2019. Concepts arising from this representation are consumer segments, intensionally described by Galois-stable sets of market-products. In this situation, let aR\u25a1x, or equivalently xR\u2666a, iff \u2018a buys x from a certain producer i\u2019. Then \u25a1\u03d5 denotes the market share of producer i in consumer segment \u03d5. As a fourth example, let P = (A,X,I) where A is the set of empirical hypotheses, X is the set of variables, and aIx iff \u2018hypothesis a is formulated in terms of variable x\u2019. Concepts arising from this representation are empirical theories, extensionally described by Galois-stable sets of hypotheses and intensionally described by Galois-stable sets of variables. In this situation, let aR\u25a1x, or equivalently xR\u2666a, iff \u2018x is a dependent variable for hypothesis a\u2019. Then \u25a1x contains all hypotheses that compete with each other. Finally, let P = (A,X,I) represent a decision-making situation in which A is the set of decisionmakers, X is the set of issues, and aIx iff \u2018agent a finds issue x relevant\u2019. Concepts arising from this representation are interrogative agendas, extensionally described by Galois-stable coalitions and intensionally described by Galois-stable sets of issues. In this situation, let aR\u25a1x, or equivalently xR\u2666a, iff \u2018agent a regards x as a positive issue\u2019. For example, if A are the members of a hiring committee and X the features of potential applicants, agent a could regard \u201cthe candidate obtained their PhD recently\u201d as a desirable characteristic, i.e. a positive issue, while other agents might prefer a more experienced candidate and therefore not regard this as positive. This would mean that R\u25a1\u2286I and that, extensionally, \u25a1\u03d5 would be the coalition of all agents who are positive towards all issues on interrogative agenda \u03d5.\n# 4.2 LE-logics as logics of informational entropy\nReflexive graphs as generalized intuitionistic frames. As discussed above, polarity-based semantics supports an interpretation of non-distributive logics as logics of formal concepts (for specific signatures: epistemic logic of concepts, logic of rough concepts etc). Under this interpretation, formulas do not denote states of affairs but rather are names for formal concepts in the sense of FCA. This interpretation can be further specialized to entities such as categories, theories, and interrogative agendas. Graph-based semantics suggests quite another interpretation of nondistributive logics, in which formulas do denote states of affairs; below we will argue that, under this interpretation, non-distributive lattice logic can be understood as a hyper-constructivist logic which generalizes intuitionistic logic just like intuitionistic logic generalizes classical logic. As discussed in Section 3.2, for any reflexive graph X = (Z,E), homomorphic assignments v : L \u2192 X+ map L-formulas \u03d5 to tuples ([[\u03d5]],([\u03d5])) which, as discussed in Section 3.4, reduce to ([[\u03d5]],[[\u03d5]]c) when E := \u2206. Hence, [[\u03d5]] = {z \u2208Z | z \u22a9\u03d5} and ([\u03d5]) = {z \u2208Z | z \u227b\u03d5} can be respectively understood as the satisfaction and refutation set of \u03d5 under v. Since ([[\u03d5]],([\u03d5])) is a Galois-stable pair, also when E := \u2206, the satisfaction and refutation set of a given formula completely determine each other via the identities ([\u03d5]) = [[\u03d5]]\u2191and [[\u03d5]] = ([\u03d5])\u2193. However, as we will see, in contrast with the classical and intuitionistic setting, at given state z, the truth value of a given formula \u03d5 can be undefined (i.e. z \u0338\u22a9\u03d5 and z \u0338\u227b\u03d5). This potential indeterminacy of formulas at states of graph-based models is the main characterizing feature of this semantic setting, and can be understood as witnessing the failure of the principle of excluded middle not just anymore at the level of the object language (as is the case of intuitionistic logic) but at\nof the graph-based semantics of non-distributive logics justifies our view of non-distributive logics as \u2018hyper-constructivist\u2019 logics. In order to discuss this generalization, it will be useful to first recall how the state-based semantics of intuitionistic logic generalizes the state-based semantic of classical propositional logic. As discussed in Section 3.2, a \u2018relational structure\u2019 for classical propositional logic is a structure F = (S,\u2206) where S a nonempty set and \u2206\u2286S\u00d7S is the identity relation. As is well known, given an assignment v : Prop \u2192F+, any formula is either true or false at each state (but at no state can a formula be both true and false), it is true precisely when its negation is false, and its truth value only depends on the values of its occurring propositional variables at the given state. A relational structure for intuitionistic propositional logic is a structure F = (S,\u2264) where S a nonempty set and \u2264is a reflexive and transitive relation. In this case, for a given assignment v : Prop \u2192F+, any formula is again either true or false at each state (but never both true and false); however, the fact that a given formula is refuted at a given state does not imply that the negation of that formula is satisfied at that state; indeed, the given state might refute both the formula and its negation, yielding the well known failure of the classical principle of excluded middle. More generally, the satisfaction of a formula at a given state might depend on the truth values of its occurring propositional variables at the successors of the given state. The characterizing properties of intuitionistic satisfaction, those that mark its difference from classical satisfaction, are all grounded on the fact that (homomorphic) assignments of proposition variables are persistent, in the sense of being upward-closed with respect to \u2264, i.e. the fact that v(\u03d5) \u2208F+ \u223c= P\u2191(S) for any formula \u03d5, and hence if \u03d5 is true at a given state s, it will remain true along any forward-looking \u2264-branch stemming from s (and dually, if \u03d5 is false at a given state s, it was so throughout any backward-looking \u2264-branch stemming from s). Persistence supports our understanding of intuitionistic truth as an inherently procedural truth: under the higher standard required by having to declare true at a given state only those statements that e.g. are backed by evidence in support of their truth at that state, or for which a procedure has been completed at that state which effectively establishes their truth, the failure of the principle of excluded middle becomes a desirable feature, since, e.g. at a given state, there might not be enough evidence in support of a given statement or in support of its negation; however, it is also reasonable to require that, once proven at a given state, a statement cannot be unproven, therefore its (proven) truth persists at the successors of the given state. As mentioned above, when moving from the Boolean to the intuitionistic setting, the meaning of the implication becomes \u201cintensional\u201d, in the specific sense that the satisfaction of p \u2192q at any given state s of an intuitionistic frame (S,\u2264) does not just depend on the value of p and q at s, but also on the values of p and q at the \u2264-successors of s. This change in the interpretation of \u2192formulas can be explained from a technical ground as the consequence of translating the interpretation of \u2192-formulas from F+ to F = (S,\u2264), as discussed in Section 3.2, when F+ is the perfect Heyting algebra P\u2191(S) rather than the perfect Boolean algebra P(S); however, this interpretation is also coherent with our understanding of intuitionistic truth as a procedural truth, since, as is well known, if a procedure is available for establishing that \u03d5 \u2192\u03c8 is true at a given state s, then at any given evolution of s (including s itself) it will be possible to use this same procedure to transform a proof of \u03d5 (whenever available) into a proof of \u03c8, and conversely. Having summarised the salient features of the state-based semantics of intuitionistic logic, the following proposition establishes how it can be seen as a special instance of graph-based semantics.\nProof. As to item 1, it is enough to show that the Galois-stable sets of P+ X \u2286P(ZA) (resp. P+ X \u2286P(ZX)) are exactly the upward-closed (resp. the downward-closed) subsets. To this end, it is enough to show that Y \u2191\u2193= Y\u2191:= {z \u2208Z | xEz for some x \u2208Y} for any Y \u2286ZA (or dually, that Y \u2193\u2191= Y\u2193:= {z \u2208Z | zEx for some x \u2208Y} for any Y \u2286ZX). Indeed, Y \u2191= {x \u2208ZX | for all a, if a \u2208Y then aEcx} = Y\u2191c. Then Y \u2191\u2193= Y\u2191c\u2193c. Given that Y\u2191is by definition an upward-closed set, Y\u2191c is a downward-closed set, hence Y\u2191c\u2193= Y\u2191c; hence, Y\u2191c\u2193c = Y\u2191cc = Y\u2191. As to item 2, for every z \u2208Z, we let z = zs = (z\u2191\u2193,z\u2191), and z = zr = (z\u2193,z\u2193\u2191). To show that E is transitive, it is enough to show that, for any u,z \u2208Z,\n# zEu iff u \u2264z.\nBy definition, u \u2264z iff z\u2191\u2286u\u2191iff {z\u2032 \u2208Z | uEz\u2032} = (u\u2191)c \u2286(z\u2191)c = {z\u2032 \u2208Z | zEz\u2032}. Since uEu by t reflexivity of E, this inclusion implies that zEu, as required. Conversely, let us assume that zEu. Th z \u2208z\u2191\u2193and z /\u2208u\u2193, hence z \u2270u. Notice that when z = u the same argument yields u \u2270u. To finish t proof, let\nIt is enough to show that: (a) u \u2264z iff z \u2270\u03ba(u), and (b) u = \u03ba(u). Before addressing (a), let us preliminarily show that z is completely join-prime for every z \u2208Z. Because by assumption X+ is completely distributive, it is enough to show that z is completely joinirreducible, and for this latter claim, it is enough to show that z \u2227z is the greatest element of X+ that is strictly less than z. Since, as discussed above, z \u2270z, it follows that z\u2227z < z. Let us show that z\u2227z is the greatest such element by showing that [[z\u2227z]] = z\u2191\u2193\\{z}. By definition, [[z\u2227z]] = [[z]] \u2229[[z]] = z\u2191\u2193\u2229z\u2193. Hence, we are left to show that z\u2191\u2193\u2229z\u2193= z\u2191\u2193\\{z}. By the reflexivity of E, if w \u2208z\u2191\u2193\u2229z\u2193then w \u0338= z, and hence w \u2208z\u2191\u2193\\ {z}. Conversely, if w \u2208z\u2191\u2193\\ {z}, the antisymmetry of E implies that either wEcz (i.e. w \u2208z\u2193, which is what we require) or zEcw (i.e. w \u2208z\u2191). This latter condition is excluded, again by the reflexivity of E and the assumption that w \u2208z\u2191\u2193. As to (a), the complete join-primeness of z implies that z \u2264\u03ba(u) = \ufffd{w | w \u2208Z and u \u2270w} iff z \u2208{w | w \u2208Z and u \u2270w} iff u \u2270z, as required. Notice that (a) instantiated to z = u yields u \u2270\u03ba(u). Notice also that (a) can be strengthened to (a\u2019): u \u2264c iff c \u2270\u03ba(u) for all u \u2208Z and c \u2208X+. Indeed, by Proposition 3.1, \ufffd{z | z \u2264c} = c \u2264\u03ba(u) iff z \u2264\u03ba(u) for every z \u2208Z such that z \u2264c, iff, by (a), u \u2270z for every z \u2208Z such that z \u2264c. By the complete join-primeness of u, the last condition is equivalent to u \u2270c. These remarks imply that \u03ba(u) is completely meet-irreducible. Indeed, let Y \u2286Z such that \ufffd{z | z \u2208 Y} = \u03ba(u). If z > \u03ba(u) for every z \u2208Y, then z \u2270\u03ba(u), i.e. by (a\u2019), u \u2264z for every z \u2208Y, and hence u \u2264\u03ba(u), contradicting u \u2270\u03ba(u). As to (b), by Proposition 3.1, u = \ufffd{w | w \u2208Z and w \u2264u} = \ufffd{w | w \u2208Z and w \u2208u\u2193}. Hence, to show that u \u2264\u03ba(u), it is enough to show that, if w \u2208u\u2193, then u /\u2208w\u2191\u2193= {z \u2208Z | \u2200z\u2032(z\u2032 \u2208w\u2191\u21d2 zEcz\u2032)}. By definition, w \u2208u\u2193iff wEcu iff u \u2208w\u2191. Moreover, by reflexivity, uEu. Hence, u /\u2208w\u2191\u2193, as required. Conversely, to show that \u03ba(u) \u2264u, notice that Proposition 3.1 and \u03ba(u) being completely meet-irreducible imply that \u03ba(u) = w for some w \u2208Z. Hence, from u \u2270\u03ba(u) = w it follows that u /\u2208w\u2193 (i.e. uEw), while from u \u2264\u03ba(u) = w it follows that w \u2208u\u2193\u2191, i.e. u\u2193\u2286w\u2193. Suppose for contradiction that u \u0338= w. Then, by antisymmetry, uEw implies that wEcu, i.e. w \u2208u\u2193\u2286w\u2193. Hence, wEcw, contradicting the reflexivity of E.\nThe proposition above shows that the Galois-stability of satisfaction (resp. refutation) sets projects onto their being \u2264-upward (resp. \u2264-downward) closed in the intuitionistic setting. This establishes a tight link between, on the one hand, the transitivity of intuitionistic frames and, on the other, a package\nZ := {u,v,z} and E := Z \u00d7Z \\{(u,z)} is an example of a reflexive, non antisymmetric and non is the 3-element chain (hence is distributive). We thank Apostolos Tzimoulis for suggesting the s of Proposition 4.1.\nZ := {u,v,z} and E := Z \u00d7Z \\{(u,z)} is an example of a reflexive, non antisymmetric and non-transitive graph such that X+ is the 3-element chain (hence is distributive). We thank Apostolos Tzimoulis for suggesting the structure of the proof of item 2 of Proposition 4.1.\n(12)\nof three characterizing properties of intuitionistic logic, namely persistence of intuitionistic satisfaction, distributivity of intuitionistic \u2227and \u2228, and the relation of refutation coinciding with the one of nonsatisfaction. In the absence of transitivity, all three properties in this package are expected to fail. Indeed, let us illustrate this fact by considering the reflexive (and antisymmetric but not transitive) graph X = (Z,E) shown in the left-hand side of the picture below. The polarity drawn in the centre of the picture is the polarity PX associated with X, and the (nondistributive) lattice on the right is X+ = P+ X.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/8562/85620b04-9f0c-47d6-b228-ce50c14b0205.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nLet us consider a (homomorphic) assignment v : L \u2192X+ such that v(p) = (z,uv) and v(q) = (u,z). The following picture shows how this assignment translates into the interpretation of p and q on X. We follow the convention that for every y \u2208Z and formula \u03d5, if y \u22a9\u03d5 then \u03d5 appears above y, and if y \u227b\u03d5 then \u03d5 appears below y.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/d860/d860925a-e7bf-4f0f-8315-8193e1adc964.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nThe left-hand side of the picture above shows that indeed, the formula q which is true at u becomes first indeterminate at v and then false at z. Hence, non-distributive satisfaction does not need to be persistent, and non-distributive refutation is different from non-satisfaction, since v \u0338\u22a9q and v \u0338\u227bq. Together with the failure of distributivity (which in the example above is yielded by the fact that X+ is nondistributive), these are the key differences setting apart non-distributive evaluation from intuitionistic evaluation. Their role in our conceptual interpretation of this semantics will be discussed below. So far, we have discussed these differences in terms of properties holding in intuitionistic models but failing in graph-based models. The following proposition identifies a property holding in graph-based models. We will refer to it as weak persistence. \u2032 \nThe left-hand side of the picture above shows that indeed, the formula q which is true at u becomes first indeterminate at v and then false at z.

So far, we have discussed these differences in terms of properties holding in intuitionistic models but failing in graph-based models. The following proposition identifies a property holding in graph-based models. We will refer to it as weak persistence. Proposition 4.2. For every (reflexive) graph X = (Z,E) any L-formula \u03d5, any z,z\u2032 \u2208Z and any homomorphic assignment v : L \u2192X+, if zEz\u2032 and z \u22a9\u03d5, then z\u2032 \u0338\u227b\u03d5. Proof. By definition, v(\u03d5) = ([[\u03d5]],([\u03d5])) \u2208X+, and hence z\u2032 \u227b\u03d5 iff z\u2032 \u2208([\u03d5]) = [[\u03d5]]\u2193= {z\u2032 \u2208Z | for all z, if z \u2208[[\u03d5]] then zEcz\u2032}. The assumptions imply that some z \u2208Z exists such that z \u2208[[\u03d5]] and zEz\u2032. From this proposition it follows that weak persistence projects onto persistence in the intuitionistic setting: indeed, as shown in the proof of item 1 of Proposition 4.1, if E is transitive, then [[\u03d5]] = ([\u03d5])c, i.e. z\u2032 \u0338\u227b\u03d5 iff z\u2032 \u22a9\u03d5 and so, if z \u22a9\u03d5 and zEz\u2032 then z\u2032 \u22a9\u03d5, in every reflexive and transitive graph-based model.\nFrom this proposition it follows that weak persistence projects onto persistence in the intuitionistic setting: indeed, as shown in the proof of item 1 of Proposition 4.1, if E is transitive, then [[\u03d5]] = ([\u03d5])c, i.e. z\u2032 \u0338\u227b\u03d5 iff z\u2032 \u22a9\u03d5 and so, if z \u22a9\u03d5 and zEz\u2032 then z\u2032 \u22a9\u03d5, in every reflexive and transitive graph-based model.\nHowever, as its name suggests, in the wider context of reflexive but not necessarily transitive graphbased models, weak persistence is strictly weaker than persistence, and hence this notion captures the difference between intuitionistic and non-distributive evaluation from yet another angle. Namely, in intuitionistic frames, any given state is bound to accept any formula supported by any of its predecessors, including itself, while in graph-based frames, any given state is only bound to not reject any formula supported by any of its predecessors, including itself; as discussed above, because of potential indeterminacy, not rejecting does not necessarily imply accepting. Hence, together with reflexivity, weak persistence guarantees that, at any given state, any given formula cannot be both accepted and rejected. As discussed above, intuitionistic truth can be construed as a procedural truth",
