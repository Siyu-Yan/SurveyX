Addressing this challenge involves developing techniques that preserve the balance between generic and specific knowledge, thereby enhancing model robustness and versatility.



DA is an essential strategy for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by facilitating the transfer of knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. This process involves identifying and leveraging domain-invariant structures to bridge the gap between the two domains, ultimately aiming to minimize the distinguishability between their distributions in the latent space. While acquiring ground-truth data for the target domain can significantly aid in domain-specific training, practical challenges often arise in obtaining this data. By optimizing the parameters of the models to improve generalization capabilities, DA enables LLMs to better adjust to specific domain requirements, thereby enhancing their overall effectiveness. \cite{park2023domainadaptationbasedhuman,zhao2017multiplesourcedomainadaptation}.
