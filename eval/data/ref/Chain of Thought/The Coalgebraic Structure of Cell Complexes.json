Introduction\n[math.CT\nThe aim of this paper is the proof of a conjecture of Richard Garner, which describes how the recent and categorically motivated concept of an algebraic weak factorisation system is deeply connected, in the specific case of topological spaces, to the more established and well understood idea of relative cell complexes. Specifically, we will prove that the left map structures (coalgebra structures) of the canonical algebraic weak factorisation system on Top are exactly the relative cell complexes. A relative cell complex is a morphism with a property: it can be expressed as a transfinite composite of pushouts of coproducts of sphere inclusions. The left map structures, on the other hand, specify an explicit choice of such an expression. We will spend some of the paper making this notion of a relative cell complex structure precise. The notion of an algebraic weak factorisation system (which we will write as \u2018awfs\u2019\u2014 both singular and plural) was introduced by Grandis and Tholen [Grandis, Tholen, 2008] as a way to make the notion of a weak factorisation system more amenable to study using the techniques of category theory. Weak factorisation systems are fundamental to homotopy theory; they are the main component of model category structures. However, they have some drawbacks: most important for Grandis and Tholen was the fact that the classes of left and right maps are not closed under colimits and limits. The definition of an awfs involves a functorial factorisation of which the left functor is a comonad and the right functor is a monad. The notions of left and right maps are naturally replaced with the coalgebras and algebras, meaning that colimits and limits are automatically available. Another possible disadvantage of weak factorisation systems is the standard method of constructing them: the small object argument. This is a transfinite induction which does the job well enough for many purposes, but which seems at odds with what should\n[math.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 18A32, 55U35.

In his paper [Garner, 2009], Richard Garner demonstrates that this can be cured; there is a very natural variant of the small object argument for awfs which does converge, does have a nice universal property, and can be considered as an instance of generating a free monoid in a monoidal category. This puts the small object argument firmly in the context of well understood categorical algebra. This discovery of Garner\u2019s has demonstrated the value of awfs as a much neater structure than weak factorisation systems. Emily Riehl has since gone on to adapt the definition of model category to that of an algebraic model category, using awfs in place of weak factorisation systems, and this work can be found in [Riehl, 2011a], [Riehl, 2011b] and [Riehl, 2011c]. At the same time Garner has been applying awfs in helping to understand higher categories, using them to classify homomorphisms between weak n-categories\u2014see [Garner, 2008]. Throughout the work of Riehl there is an emphasis on the right maps\u2014the algebras\u2014 of a given awfs. There was a good reason for this; Garner proved (in [Garner, 2009]) a theorem that characterised the right maps in any cofibrantly generated awfs\u2014a right map structure on a morphism is precisely a choice of solution for every lifting problem with a generating left map. Unfortunately, there was no such easy description of left map structures. It was clear that any relative cell complex had a left map structure and that any left map was at least a retract of a relative cell complex; Garner\u2019s conjecture, which we attack in this paper, was that the left maps are exactly the relative cell complexes (in the specific case of Top with the standard awfs). This result will allow us to access the left maps too. What is more, the left maps\u2014as cell complexes\u2014are in many ways much more accessible and understandable than the right maps. It is hard to give an example of a right map structure that is neither trivial nor very complex, because of the infinite number of liftings that must be specified. But to give a simple, finite, example of a left map structure is very easy! The left maps have a constructive flavour that makes them, in the author\u2019s opinion, easier to work with. The result will also establish an important link between awfs and the homotopy theory which is already understood. The relative cell complexes are a class of maps that have been around for a long time, and they are fundamental to model categories; in a sense, it is important to check that they are indeed the left maps of the awfs in order to make sure that the awfs fits properly into the existing theory. While this paper\u2019s result is restricted to one particular awfs, the technique used should easily generalise to many other examples. In this case, there are potential applications to higher category theory: in the case of weak n-categories, the relative cell complexes are very closely connected to the idea of computads.

This potential for generalisation will be discussed further in Section 10.\nThe approach. We will prove the theorem by first considering the existing definition of relative cell complex, which gives a class of morphisms in Top. In Section 4 we adjust this definition in order to obtain a category CellCx which has a natural forgetful functor U to Top2. After making sure that this category defines a sensible notion of \u2018cell complex structure\u2019 on a map, we exhibit a right adjoint to U, in Section 5. This adjunction can be thought of as a nice concrete expression of the small object argument; the universal property of a free cell complex is exactly analogous to the lifting property the small object argument is designed to obtain. The smallness condition, which we expect to find somewhere, appears sooner than you might expect\u2014it is required for composition to be defined on cell complexes, in Section 4. In Section 6 we demonstrate that the adjunction is comonadic, so cell complexes are coalgebras for the comonad UK. In Section 7 we will see how UK is the left hand side of an awfs, and in Section 8 we describe the universal property that CellCx satisfies. This allows us, in the remaining Section 9, to prove that UK is isomorphic as a comonad to L, the left hand functor of the awfs we are interested in. This proves our main result: that our notion of cell complex structure is equivalent to the left map structures.\nAcknowledgements.

Background\nAny functorial factorisation on a category C can be described as a pair (L, R) of a copointed endofunctor and a pointed endofunctor on C2 (the category of arrows in C), with the following properties: \u2022 L is domain preserving, \u2022 R is codomain preserving, \u2022 the functors cod \u25e6L and dom \u25e6R are equal, \u2022 Rf \u25e6Lf = f for any f. It is useful to give the functor cod \u25e6L, or equivalently dom \u25e6R, a name; we will call it the central functor of (L, R), and generally write it as M : C2 \u2192C. In an algebraic weak factorisation system, we simply ask that L be a comonad and R be a monad. This turns out to be essentially the same as making a choice of solution for every lifting problem between a coalgebra and an algebra. We should note that the original name was natural weak factorisation system; we follow the name adopted by [Riehl, 2011a].\nIt is useful to give the functor cod \u25e6L, or equivalently dom \u25e6R, a name; we will call it the central functor of (L, R), and generally write it as M : C2 \u2192C.

This turns out to be essentially the same as making a choice of solution for every lifting problem between a coalgebra and an algebra. We should note that the original name was natural weak factorisation system; we follow the name adopted by [Riehl, 2011a].\n2.1. Definition. An algebraic weak factorisation system on a category C is a pair (L, R) where L = (L,\u20d7\u01eb,\u20d7\u03b4) is a comonad on C2, R = (R, \u20d7\u03b7, \u20d7\u00b5) is a monad on C2, the copointed endofunctor (L,\u20d7\u01eb) together with the pointed endofunctor (R, \u20d7\u03b7) make up the data of a single functorial factorisation, and the pair satisfies the distributivity axiom, explained below. The final condition will ensure that the monad and comonad behave properly with respect to one another. It follows from the monad laws that \u20d7\u03b4 must have trivial domain component and \u20d7\u00b5 must have trivial codomain component, so their components take the forms (1, \u03b4f) and (\u00b5f, 1):\nfor some \u03b4f and \u00b5f. Then we can define a natural transformation \u2206: LR \u2192RL with components given by (\u03b4f, \u00b5f). The distributivity axiom says that this is a distributive law of the comonad over the monad, meaning that it commutes with the unit, counit, multiplication and comultiplication transformations. The best notions of left map and right map are now given to us by the algebraic structure. Let L-Map be the category of coalgebras for the comonad L and let R-Map be the category of algebras for the monad R. What exactly does a left map structure on a morphism in M look like? As always, a coalgebra is an object f : A \u2192B equipped with a structure map f \u2192Lf, which appears in this case as map \u03b1:\na kind of \u2018partial inverse\u2019 to f. The coalgebra axioms translate into very natural properties for \u03b1; in particular \u03b1 \u25e6f = Lf and Rf \u25e6\u03b1 = 1B. They also force the domain part of the structure map to be the identity on A\u2014this is why we can represent the left map structure with just one morphism in Top. In his paper [Garner, 2009] Garner introduces a revised version of the small object argument. This allows us to take any category I over C2 (assuming some smallness conditions similar to those for the original small object argument) and produce an awfs for which the category I is naturally a subcategory of the left map category. The argument is a transfinite iteration where a single step performed on f : A \u2192B involves considering the set of commutative squares\nwhere i is in the category I, and then forming the pushout of A with many copies of each i \u2208I, one for each of the squares. This can be visualised as \u2018gluing\u2019 many cells onto A\u2014one for every way such a cell can be included in B via f. When we iterate, we are essentially adding layer after layer of cells in this way. In Garner\u2019s small object argument, there is a mechanism to prevent us from adding superfluous cells, and as a result the sequence converges. We obtain a factorisation of f : A \u2192Mf \u2192B, where any cell complex in B can be lifted to Mf. We now consider the set of morphisms in Top, given by the the inclusion Sn\u22121 \u2192 Dn for all n \u22650, where S\u22121 is considered to be the empty space and S0 the pair of endpoints for D1. We call this J and will treat it as a discrete category over Top2. Applying the small object argument to J produces an awfs on Top which is arguably the most fundamental interesting example for homotopy theory; it is very close to the weak factorisation system between cofibrations and trivial Serre fibrations that appears in the standard model category structure on Top. For the rest of this paper we will write it as (L, R); this is the awfs for which we prove our result.\n# 3. Strata\nThe class of morphisms in Top which we write as J -cell and call the relative J -cell complexes is usually defined to be the smallest class containing J which is closed under coproducts, pushouts and transfinite composition. Starting with this notion, we seek to define a category of relative J -cell complexes, which we will call CellCx. There will be a forgetful functor U : CellCx \u2192Top2 whose image is precisely J -cell. In other words, every morphism in J -cell will have one or more cell complex structure. We\u2019ll introduce some helpful notation at this point. If A is a relative cell complex, we will generally write UA as \u2202A \u2192A, and we\u2019ll call \u2202A the boundary or base space of A, and A the body of A. In our definition, cell complexes will be formed as sequences of layers which we call strata. Each stratum is the pushout of a coproduct of single cells. 3.1. Definition. A stratum (X, S) consists of the following data: a topological space X, a set of cells S, and for each s \u2208S a choice of \u03bas \u2208J and a continuous map bs : \u2202\u03bas \u2192X. The boundary of the stratum is X, and the body is given by the following pushout square: \ufffd\n3.1. Definition. A stratum (X, S) consists of the following data: a topological space X a set of cells S, and for each s \u2208S a choice of \u03bas \u2208J and a continuous map bs : \u2202\u03bas \u2192X The boundary of the stratum is X, and the body is given by the following pushout square: \ufffd\nSo we can consider a stratum as a special sort of relative cell complex, for which U(X, S) is the bottom arrow of the diagram. We will later define general relative cell complexes as sequences of strata satisfying certain properties; first we will consider some properties of the category of strata. To work with the category Strata we must first define the morphisms.\n3.2. Definition. Let (X, S) and (Y, T) be any two strata. A morphism of strata (f, p): (X, S) \u2192(Y, T) is a continuous function f : X \u2192Y and a function p: S \u2192T, satisfying the requirement that for every s \u2208S, \u03bas = \u03bap(s) and f \u25e6bs = bp(s). Composition is the obvious thing: (f, p) \u25e6(f \u2032, p\u2032) = (f \u25e6f \u2032, p \u25e6p\u2032). The functor U : Strata \u2192Top2 is defined as one would expect; \u2202(f, p) is just f, and (f, p): (X, S) \u2192 (Y, T) is the unique map making the various diagrams commute. The first thing we note about Strata is that each object J of J has a canonical stratastructure, (\u2202J, {\u2217}) where \u03ba\u2217= J and b\u2217= 1\u2202J. Secondly, we note that strata-structures can be transferred along pushout: if f : X \u2192Y has a strata-structure (X, S) then in the pushout\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4bf8/4bf8270d-099a-4331-8173-2931d133460d.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n  the bottom map has a canonical strata-structure, given in the following definition. 3.3. Definition. Given any stratum (X, S) and map g : X \u2192Z, the pushforward of (X, S) along g, which we write g\u2217(X, S), is the stratum (Z, S) with each \u03bas the same as in the original stratum and each bs given by the original bs composed with g. We can see that Z \ufffd X Y is the body of (Z, S) by commutativity of pushouts. Next we will consider colimits in Strata. (0.45) 3.4. Proposition. The category Strata has all small colimits, and the functor U : Strata \u2192Top2 preserves them. Proof. We check coproducts and then coequalisers. Let (Xa, Sa) be a set of strata indexed by A. We claim that\nwhere each \u03bas is the same as its original on the left, and each bs is given by composition of its original with the inclusion map. Given a set of strata morphisms (\u03bba, \u03c1a): (Xa, Sa) \u2192 (Y, T) there is a unique pair (f, p) making the following diagrams commute:\nWe must merely check that this (f, p) is a strata morphism; given s \u2208Sa, \u03bas = \u03ba\u03c1a(s) = \u03bap(s), and bp(s) = \u03bba \u25e6bs = f \u25e6ia \u25e6bs where ia is the inclusion Xa \u2192\ufffdXa. We see that U preserves this coproduct because pushouts and coproducts commute.\nAs for coequalisers, consider a pair of strata morphisms (f, p) and (g, q) between (X, S) and (Y, T). We claim their coequaliser is the strata formed by the coequaliser of f and g and the coequaliser of p and q, which we will write as (Z, U). Each u \u2208U is an equivalence class of elements of T, all of which must have the same \u03bat, giving us \u03bau. They don\u2019t necessarily all have the same bt. However, we know the equivalence relation is generated by p(s) \u223cq(s). Since bp(s) = f \u25e6bs and bq(s) = g \u25e6bs when we compose them with the coequaliser map Y \u2192Z we get a unique definition of bu, which makes the map (l, m) below into a strata morphism.\nTo check the coequaliser property, let (h, r) coequalise (f, p) and (g, q). We get a unique pair (k, s) making the diagrams commute; as before we must simply check this is a strata morphism. For u \u2208U, \u03bas(u) = \u03bar(t) = \u03bat = \u03bau, using any t in the equivalence class of u. Also, bs(u) = h \u25e6bt = k \u25e6l \u25e6bt = k \u25e6bu. Finally, we must check U preserves this coequaliser; clearly \ufffd\u03bau is the coequaliser of the two maps \ufffd\u03bas \u2192\ufffd\u03bat given by p and q, so the result follows because coequalisers commute with pushouts.\n3.5.

Firstly, we know that X is a subspace of (X, S). Given a point x \u2208(X, S), assume it is not in X. Then it must be in some cell s \u2208S: it is a point in \u03bas, and not a point of the boundary \u2202\u03bas. So its image under (f, p) is in the same position in the corresponding cell p(s) \u2208T, and hence not in Y . This demonstrates that as a point set, X is the pullback; since it is a subspace of X, and this determines its open sets, it is also the pullback as a space.\nNow we understand the category of strata, we will move on to general cell complexes. These are defined as infinite sequences of strata satisfying two important properties. The first property says that the strata link together correctly, while the second is a kind of normal form property: it says that every cell appears in the lowest possible stratum. 4.1. Definition. An infinite sequence of strata is connected if the boundary of each stratum is equal to the body of the previous stratum. 4.2. Definition. An infinite sequence of strata, (Xn, Sn)N, is proper if there is no s \u2208Sn for any n such that bs can be factored through the boundary of a lower stratum. 4.3. Definition. A relative cell complex is a proper connected sequence of strata. The image under U of such a relative cell complex is the transfinite composite in Top of all the U(Xn, Sn). Again we will talk about the boundary \u2202(Xn, Sn)N and the body (Xn, Sn)N. A relative cell complex has infinite height if no Sn is empty. Alternatively it has height n if Sn+1 is the first empty set of cells. Clearly (because of the required property of properness) if Sn is empty, then so is Sm for all m > n. The trivial cell complex on X is the unique height 0 cell complex with boundary X. We define a morphism of cell complexes by similarly extending the definition for morphisms of strata. 4.4. Definition. Given any two relative cell complexes (Xn, Sn)N and (Yn, Tn)N, a relative cell complex morphism between them is a sequence of morphisms of strata, (fn, pn)N : (Xn, Sn)N \u2192(Yn, Tn)N, satisfying the coherence condition\u2014that fn+1 = (fn, pn) for all n \u22650.

Given any two relative cell complexes (Xn, Sn)N and (Yn, Tn)N, a relative cell complex morphism between them is a sequence of morphisms of strata, (fn, pn)N : (Xn, Sn)N \u2192(Yn, Tn)N, satisfying the coherence condition\u2014that fn+1 = (fn, pn) for all n \u22650. The image under U appears as\nwhere (fn, pn)N is the unique map that makes the diagram commute. We will write CellCx for the category whose objects are relative cell complexes and whose morphisms are relative cell complex morphisms. Strata embeds in CellCx as the subcategory of complexes with height less than or equal to one. We must check a few important facts about CellCx. Firstly, we want to extend the result about colimits from Strata to CellCx. Secondly, we look at some other constructions that can be made in the category. Finally, to make sure it is a good candidate for a \u2018category of relative cell complexes\u2019, we show that the image of U in Top2 is exactly the class J -cell. 4.5. Proposition. The category CellCx has all small colimits, and the functor U preserves them.\nProof. In fact, the colimits of CellCx can be computed component-wise; so given a diagram of cell complexes the colimit is given by taking a colimit of strata for each natural number n. This defines a sequence of strata, and a sequence of strata morphisms. We must check these are connected, proper and coherent. We will need some notation; let the diagram consist of (Xdn, Sdn)N for d ranging over the objects of the diagram category, let the proposed colimit be (Zn, Un)N and let the colimit cocone morphisms be (fdn, pdn)N : (Xdn, Sdn)N \u2192(Zn, Un)N. By connectedness, each (Xdn, Sdn) = Xd(n+1). Since U preserves the colimits of strata, (Zn, Un) is the colimit of the (Xdn, Sdn), meaning that we can choose it to be equal to Zn+1. This shows our proposed colimit cell complex is connected. By the same argument fd(n+1) = (fdn, pdn); so we\u2019ve also shown that the (fdn, pdn)N are all coherent. Properness is harder to show; we will use the Pullback Lemma for strata. Assume the proposed colimit is improper: let u \u2208Un with bu factorable through Zn\u22121 as in the diagram.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/2bcd/2bcd04b5-4a18-4f45-9dac-9575390e8730.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nNow let s \u2208Sdn be some cell with the property that pdn(s) = u; such a cell must exist by the definition of Un as a colimit. Thus the map bu can also be factorised through Xdn using bs. Using the pullback square we get a factorisation of bs through Xd(n\u22121), yeilding a contradiction because the objects in the diagram are assumed to be cell complexes, and hence proper. We also need to check the colimit property. Given a cocone of morphisms (Xdn, Sdn)N \u2192 (Yn, Tn)N, there is a unique candidate sequence of strata morphisms (gn, qn)N : (Zn, Un)N \u2192 (Yn, Tn)N given by each individual colimit property in Strata. We just have to check this sequence is coherent; this follows easily from the fact that each sequence of strata is connected and that U preserves colimits of strata. Finally, since U of a cell complex is defined by transfinite composition, we can see that U preserves colimits using the fact that transfinite composition commutes with other colimits. Now recall the definition of pushforwards in the category Strata; this can be extended to CellCx. We construct the pushforward of each stratum in turn and because of the connectedness property there is only one way this can be done. 4.6. Definition. Given any cell complex (Xn, Sn)N and any map g : X0 \u2192Z, the pushforward of (Xn, Sn)N along g, which we write as g\u2217(Xn, Sn)N, is the following (Zn, Sn)N. Firstly, Z0 = Z and (Z0, S0) is the stratum g\u2217(X0, S0). There is then a map (X0, S0) \u2192(Z0, S0) which we call g1; (Z1, S1) is defined to be the stratum (g1)\u2217(X1, S1). Continuing in this manner we construct each stratum of (Z, S), and we obtain a mor-\n4.6. Definition. Given any cell complex (Xn, Sn)N and any map g : X0 \u2192Z, the pushforward of (Xn, Sn)N along g, which we write as g\u2217(Xn, Sn)N, is the following (Zn, Sn)N. Firstly, Z0 = Z and (Z0, S0) is the stratum g\u2217(X0, S0). There is then a map (X0, S0) \u2192(Z0, S0) which we call g1; (Z1, S1) is defined to be the stratum (g1)\u2217(X1, S1). Continuing in this manner we construct each stratum of (Zn, Sn)N, and we obtain a morphism of cell complexes where each commutative square in the sequence is a pushout\nsquare. It is a trivial equivalence of two colimits to see that then Ug\u2217(Xn, Sn)N is t pushout of U(Xn, Sn)N along g.\nA new construction that we can perform in CellCx, which was not possible in Strata, is that of composition. Suppose we are given two cell complexes, with the boundary of the second equal to the body of the first. Because of some smallness conditions satisfied by the maps of J in Top, we can combine the two into a single complex, whose underlying map is the composite in Top of the underlying maps of the two original complexes. This construction expresses the intuition that cell complexes can be glued onto one another to make larger complexes. To define the composite of two cell complexes in general, we will start with a simple case. Let (Xn, Sn)N be any cell complex and (Y, T) be a stratum, which we consider as a height one cell complex. Also let Y = (Xn, Sn)N, so that composition makes sense. We define the composite, which we will write as (Zn, Un)N, as follows. First, we use the standard result (see, for example, Proposition 2.4.2 in [Hovey, 1999]) that compact spaces are finite relative to closed T1 inclusions. Each map Xn \u2192Xn+1 is a closed T1 inclusion, and the boundary of every cell is compact\u2014hence for every t \u2208T there is a smallest nt such that bt factors through Xnt. This partitions T into a sequence of sets, (Tn)N. Now let Z0 = X0 and let U0 = S0 + T0. Thereafter, we let each Zn = (Zn\u22121, Un\u22121) and each Un = Sn + Tn, where all the bs and bt are defined in the obvious way. A straightforward equivalence of two colimits shows that the underlying map of the composite is the composite of the underlying maps. It is also important to note that there is a canonical cell complex morphism (Xn, Sn)N \u2192(Zn, Un)N, with (1X0, U(Y, T)) as its underlying morphism in Top2:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/1ba3/1ba3ce98-950a-4563-8f91-ab1bc925cefe.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n4.7. Definition. Given any two cell complexes A and B, such that the body of A is the boundary of B, we define the composite B \u2217A by repeating the above construction for each stratum in B. This gives a sequence of cell complexes An, where each An is A with the first n strata of B composed onto it. Because we have all small colimits in CellCx, we can define B \u2217A as the colimit of this sequence, and because U preserves colimits, this has the correct composite as its underlying map. We note here that this definition of composite can be extended easily to composing a transfinite sequence of cell complexes, using exactly the same technique\u2014any ordinal sequence of cell complexes gives an ordinal sequence of strata which we add one by one, taking the colimit at each limit ordinal. Another very important observation is the following: 4.8. Proposition. Given a pair of cell complex morphisms \u03c6: A \u2192A\u2032 and \u03c8: B \u2192B\u2032, if A and B are composable, A\u2032 and B\u2032 are composable, and \u2202\u03c8 = \u03c6, then they give rise\nto a new cell complex morphism \u03c8 \u2217\u03c6: B \u2217A \u2192B\u2032 \u2217A\u2032, such that U(\u03c8 \u2217\u03c6) = (\u2202\u03c6, \u03c8) We call it the horizontal composite of the two cell complex morphisms.\nProof. Consider the case where B and B\u2032 are height one, write B = (Y, T) and B\u2032 = (Y \u2032, T \u2032), and let \u03c8 = (g, q): we must check that q respects the partitioning of T and T \u2032 into (Tn)N and (T \u2032 n)N; that is, for each u \u2208U, we want nu = nq(u). But nq(u) \u2264nu follows from the fact that (g, q) is a strata morphism, and the pullback lemma ensures that nu \u2264nq(u). Now an induction argument on the height of B will show that \u03c8 \u2217\u03c6 is well defined.\nIt is worth noting that we have now defined a double category whose objects ar spaces, whose vertical morphisms are continuous functions, whose horizontal morphism are cell complexes and whose 2-cells are cell complex morphisms.\noposition. The image of the functor U : CellCx \u2192Top2 is exactly the class\n4.9. Proposition. The image of the functor U : CellCx \u2192Top2 is exactly the c of morphisms J -cell.\nProof. Firstly, the definition of U(Xn, Sn)N is as a transfinite composite of pushouts of coproducts of elements of J , so the image is certainly a subclass of J -cell. To show the opposite inclusion, since it is clear that each element of J has a CellCx structure, we need only check that the image of U is closed under coproducts, pushouts and transfinite composites. We have just proved that all colimits exist in CellCx and are preserved by U, and we have just defined pushforwards of cell complexes. We have also just defined composites, and as we pointed out these are easily extended to transfinite composites.\nFinally, there\u2019s also a pullback lemma for cell complexe\n# Finally, there\u2019s also a pullback lemma for cell complexes.\n4.10. Lemma. [Pullback Lemma for Cell Complexes] Given any morphism of ce complexes, its image under U, when viewed as a commutative square in Top, is a pullbac square.\nProof. Let (fn, pn)N : (Xn, Sn)N \u2192(Yn, Tn)N be a cell complex morphism. Any map from the one point space to (Xn, Sn)N must factor through some Xn, because the one point space is compact. Thus, given a point in Y0 and a point in (Xn, Sn)N with the same image in (Yn, Tn)N, a finite number of applications of the pullback lemma for strata will give a unique point in X0, and this shows that as a set at least, X0 is the pullback we want it to be. But its open subsets are determined by the subspace inclusion into (Xn, Sn)N, and this shows that it is indeed the pullback.\n4.11. Remark. This result is really a little stronger than stated; it implies that given any morphism of cell complexes one can remove any finite number of strata from the beginning and the remaining square is also a pullback in Top\u2014simply because it is also a morphism of cell complexes. This fact will be vital in Section 6.\nWe now examine some more properties of the category of cell complexes; they will let us see that it is a category of left maps, and in fact one with a useful universal property with respect to J . First we show that there is a right adjoint to U, which makes an adjunction that will turn out to be comonadic. In order to construct this right adjoint K, we will first restrict our attention to Strata, and then consider the whole of CellCx. It is worth bearing in mind that the construction in this section is very closely analogous to the small object argument; the first proposition gives a single step, the second proposition iterates it. 5.1.

Notice that any element s \u2208S comes with a canonical choice of \u03bas \u2208J and bs : \u2202\u03bas \u2192A. This means that (A, S) is a stratum. It also comes with a canonical morphism (1A, E1f): U(A, S) \u2192f in Top2, whose codomain part E1f : (A, S) \u2192B is determined by the pushout property of (A, S), using f and the codomain part of each s \u2208S. We claim that we have just constructed K1f, and that (1A, E1f) is the counit of the adjunction. Suppose (X, T) is any stratum and (g, h): U(X, T) \u2192f a morphism of Top2. Because of the pushout definition of (X, T), the function h is determined by g and a morphism ht : U\u03bat \u2192f in Top2 for each t \u2208T; this is all the information that makes up (g, h). But each ht gives an element s \u2208S, so this information also exactly defines a morphism of strata, (g, t \ufffd\u2192ht): (X, T) \u2192(A, S), and factors (g, h) through (1A, E1f). The factorisation is unique because E1f is epic; we have demonstrated the correspondence necessary for K1 to be the right adjoint of U. The construction in this proof of E1f and UK1f is a functorial factorisation of f\u2014 exactly the factorisation produced by the first step of either small object argument (Garner\u2019s or Quillen\u2019s). In the next proposition we extend the right adjoint to CellCx, iterating in precisely the manner of Garner\u2019s small object argument.\n# .2. Proposition. The functor U : CellCx \u2192Top2 has a right adjoint K.\nProof. In the proof of the previous proposition, we constructed a right adjoint to K1: Top2 \u2192Strata for U in the case of strata. We also defined a functor E1: Top2 \u2192 Top2 which appeared in the counit of the adjunction and which will prove rather useful. Again, consider f : A \u2192B, any object of Top2. Apply K1 to f to obtain the stratum\n(A, S) and the function E1f : (A, S) \u2192B. Then apply K1 again, this time to E1f, to get another stratum whose boundary is (A, S). This also gives another new function E1E1f, to which we apply K1 in turn. Continuing this process gives a connected sequence of strata, which would be a good candidate for Kf, except for one problem: the sequence is not proper. A similar approach does work, however (with a little bit more work) if we deliberately omit the improper cells at each stage. Let A0 = A and S0 = S as defined above; there are no improper cells in the first stratum, so (A0, S0) is the first stratum of Kf. We let A1 = (A0, S0) and define S1 to be the set of morphisms Uj \u2192E1f in Top2, for any j \u2208J , satisfying the additional condition that their boundary maps do not factor through A0. As before, (A1, S1) is clearly a stratum and we get a new morphism E2f : (A1, S1) \u2192B. We can continue in this fashion, defining An to be (An\u22121, Sn\u22121) and Sn to be the set of morphisms Uj \u2192Enf whose boundary maps do not factor through An\u22121. This produces a connected sequence of strata which is this time proper by construction. Furthermore, there is an unique map Ef : (An, Sn)N \u2192B which commutes with all the Enf.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/13e1/13e1fce6-b3db-4d27-b8f5-1cb616e4817c.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nLet (Xn, Tn)N be any cell complex and (g, h): U(Xn, Tn)N \u2192f a map of Top2. The first thing we note is that the map h corresponds to an infinite sequence of maps, one from each Xn; we call this hn : Xn \u2192B. Now (g, h1) is a map in Top2 from U(X0, T0) to f, so by the adjunction between Strata and Top2 we obtain a strata morphism (g, p0): (X0, T0) \u2192 (A0, S0). Say g0 = g, and g1 = (g0, p0). Then (g1, h2) is a map in Top2 from U(X1, T1) to E1f; this induces a strata morphism (g1, p1): (X1, T1) \u2192(A1, S1)\u2014use the same argument as to construct the morphism (X1, T1) \u2192K1E1f, and note that each of the cells in the image is proper. If some cell t \u2208T1 were to have bp1(t) that could factor through X0, then by the Pullback Lemma bt would factor through X0 which is impossible. Now we repeat the construction of (g1, p1) to define a sequence of strata morphisms (gn, pn)N : (Xn, Tn)N \u2192(An, Sn)N which is automatically coherent. Since Enf \u25e6gn = hn for each n, we have Ef \u25e6(gn, pn)N = h and we have factored (g, h) through (1A, Ef). The factorisation is unique, again because Ef can be seen to be epimorphic.

Comonadicity\nTwo lemmas will be sufficient for us to prove that the adjunction is comonadic; we\u2019ll use the standard result known as Beck\u2019s Monadicity Theorem, which can be found in [Mac Lane, 1998] and many other places besides.\n1. Lemma. The category CellCx has all equalisers, and the functor U preserves al ualisers.\n1. Lemma. The category CellCx has all equalisers, and the functor U preserves all\n6.1. Lemma. The category CellCx has all equalisers, and the functor equalisers.\nProof. We start by showing this result for Strata. Let (f, p) and (g, q) be two strata morphisms from (X, S) to (Y, T). Now let e: E \u2192X be the equaliser of f and g in Top, and let r: L \u2192S be the equaliser of p and q in Set. We claim that (e, r): (E, L) \u2192(X, S) is the equaliser we are looking for in Strata. Firstly, we must check it is actually a stratum; given l \u2208L, because p(r(l)) = q(r(l)) we have f \u25e6br(l) = g \u25e6br(l) so there\u2019s a unique map \u2202\u03bar(l) \u2192E which we use to define bl. This definition of \u03bal and bl makes (e, r) automatically a strata morphism; we must just check the limit property. Given a stratum morphism (h, m): (Z, W) \u2192(X, S) which also equalises (f, p) and (g, q), we get a unique pair (k, n): (Z, W) \u2192(E, L), shown by the dotted arrow:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/fc3f/fc3f9bef-2fbd-47e6-b64e-84310f3daff2.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nThis (k, n) is a strata morphism: it is clear that for any w \u2208W, \u03baw = \u03ban(w) and e\u25e6k\u25e6bw = h \u25e6bw = bm(w) = e \u25e6bn(w), which implies k \u25e6bw = bn(w) because e is monic. Furthermore, U preserves this equaliser: consider its image under U\u2014firstly, the boundary E is by definition the equaliser we want. Secondly, a point in (X, S) has the same image under f and g iff it is either in E \u2282X or in a cell s \u2208S such that p(s) = q(s); hence as a point set, (E, U) is the equaliser. As a space, its topology is determined by it being a subspace of (X, S), so we are done. To extend to CellCx, we use a very similar argument to that in Proposition 4.5; we claim the equaliser of a pair of cell complex morphisms is given as the sequence of equalisers of strata. This sequence is connected, and the sequence of morphisms is coherent, by exactly the same reasoning as in Proposition 4.5. To show it is proper is in fact much easier here, because the equaliser is a subcomplex of the first cell complex\u2014the equaliser map is a sequence of strata inclusions. We also check the limit property; this follows from the same argument as in Proposition 4.5. Finally, consider the image under U. Using the result for Strata, the boundary of each stratum in the equaliser is the correct equaliser in Top. Then, because every point in the body appears in the boundary of some stratum (since the one point space is compact) the image under U is correct as a function of sets. It then follows it is correct as a continuous function between spaces, again by considering subspace inclusions which determine its topology.\nProof. As usual, we prove this for Strata and then extend the result to CellCx. Let (f, p): (X, S) \u2192(Y, T) be a strata morphism and assume that U(f, p) is an isomorphism in Top2. We consider the inverse of U(f, p) in Top2, which we will write (g, h). The function h is determined by g and a morphism ht : \u03bat \u2192U(X, S) for each t \u2208T; and U(f, p) \u25e6ht is the canonical inclusion of \u03bat into U(Y, T). This means that each ht makes a choice of h\u2032(t) \u2208S such that p(h\u2032(t)) = t and h\u2032(p(s)) = s. This shows that (g, h) has a strata morphism structure given by (g, h\u2032), and this strata morphism is an inverse to (f, p), showing that it is an isomorphism, and hence that U : Strata \u2192Top2 is conservative. Consider a morphism of cell complexes, (fn, pn)N : (Xn, Sn)N \u2192(Yn, Tn)N, and assume its image under U is an isomorphism. This immediately shows that f0 is an isomorphism. Using the remark following the pullback lemma for cell complexes, each fn is a pullback of (fn, pn)N, and since the pullback of an isomorphism is an isomorphism, all the fn are isomorphisms. Now use the result on Strata to see that all the strata morphisms (fn, pn) are individually isomorphisms; hence, (fn, pn)N is an isomorphism and we are done. 6.3. Corollary. Since U is conservative, CellCx has and U preserves all equalisers, the dual of Beck\u2019s monadicity theorem implies that the adjunction between U and K is comonadic.\n# 7. The awfs\nAt this stage it follows directly from a result of Garner (the dual of Theorem 4.9 in [Barthel, Riehl, 2012]) that, since we have a comonad UK whose category of coalgebras admits a composition law, it must appear as part of an awfs whose monad part is given by the counit. However, in the interests of clarity we will spend some time proving this fact explicitly. From now on we will observe the notational convention of writing morphisms in Top2 and CellCx vertically (as squares where the source and target morphisms are horizontal). This seems to make the diagrams clearer, and is appropriate if one considers the double category point of view. In some of the diagrams we will also use a notational shorthand where instead of explicitly writing a map and its factorisation, we draw arrows going to and from the middle of an arrow to mean morphisms to and from the central object of that arrow\u2019s factorisation. Thus a left map will be drawn as\nand the image of a morphism (a, b) in Top2 under the factorisation will be drawn as\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/d981/d9813c9a-002c-426b-9dcc-3f8bfb86d6c9.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nArrows to and from the one quarter point or three quarters point of an arrow mean the obvious thing, where the left or right part of a factorisation has been factorised again.\n7.1. Proposition. The endofunctor E on Top2, which was defined in Proposition 5.2 is a monad.\nProof. In Definition 4.7 and Proposition 4.8 we showed how cell complex structures can be composed; this will provide us with the multiplication for the monad E. Firstly, the unit \u20d7\u03b7: 1 \u2192E is given by \u20d7\u03b7f = (UKf, 1B) where f : A \u2192B. Now, KEf is a cell complex which can be composed with Kf; we write the composite KEf \u2217Kf. There is a morphism in Top2 given by (1A, EEf): U(KEf \u2217Kf) \u2192f, hence by the adjunction there is a cell complex morphism \u03c6: KEf \u2217Kf \u2192Kf. We define \u00b5f to be the codomain part of U\u03c6, and claim that \u03b7 and \u20d7\u00b5 = (\u00b5, 1) make E into a monad. First we check that \u20d7\u00b5 is a natural transformation (this is clear in the case of \u20d7\u03b7). Consider (a, b): f \u2192g any morphism of Top2; in the diagram\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/6271/627133ca-5125-4bc5-a056-757561010902.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nwe wish to compare the two sides of the naturality square which are K(a, b) \u25e6\u00b5f and \u00b5g \u25e6K(K(a, b), b). Because these are both the body maps of cell complex morphisms whose boundary maps are a, we can use the adjunction between U and K. It\u2019s a quick diagram chase to see that either side when composed with Eg gives b\u25e6EEf, which means, by the adjunction, that they are equal and \u20d7\u00b5 is natural. To check the monad laws, we use a similar method: Ef \u25e6\u00b5f \u25e6UKEf = EEf \u25e6 UKEf = Ef immediately shows that \u20d7\u00b5 \u25e6UK\u03b7 = 1, and the other unit law follows from Ef \u25e6\u00b5f \u25e6K(UKf, 1B) = EEf \u25e6K(UKf, 1B) = Ef. Finally, to demonstrate the multiplication law, we wish to show that the diagram\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0e54/0e54de7f-cc0c-409a-bcd2-9092a52c96ba.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nand the fact that the two maps we are comparing are both the body maps of cell complex morphisms, we can use the adjunction again and the multiplication law holds.\nhe pair (UK, E) is an algebraic weak factorisation system\nProof. We have seen already that UK is a comonad, E is a monad and that they fit together to form a functorial factorisation system. This is almost all that is required to make (UK, E) an awfs; the only remaining thing to check is the distributivity axiom. There is a natural transformation \u2206: UKE \u21d2EUK with components given by the square\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/a00d/a00d6dbf-b857-48d1-b551-419a68f3f1d0.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nwhere \u03b4f is the codomain part of the comultiplication of UK. This \u2206is required to be what is called a distributive law of UK over E; this means it must satisfy four commutative diagrams, basically saying it commutes with the unit, counit, multiplication and comultiplication of UK and E. When we translate these commutative diagrams into components in Top2, they become eight identities in Top. Upon examination, six of these identities are immediately true: four of them from the comonad and monad laws, and two of them simply by definition of \u00b5 and \u03b4.

Again, checking the coalgebra axioms is very straightforward. Now, as a rather important sanity check before we continue, we check the two definitions of composites and pushforwards agree in CellCx. 7.5. Proposition. The definition of composition in CellCx given in Definition 4.7 is the same as the general definition applied to CellCx as the category of left maps for the awfs (UK, E).\nProof. Given two cell complexes, considered as left maps (f, \u03b1) and (g, \u03b2), it is enough to check that (1A, \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b1) is a cell complex morphism (g, \u03b2) \u2217(f, \u03b1) \u2192K(gf). Then by the adjunction between U and K, the fact that E(gf) \u25e6(\u03b2 \u2022 \u03b1) = 1C (which is one of the coalgebra axioms) implies that the left map structure is the correct one. To show it is a cell complex morphism, factorise it as\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/e045/e045362f-f605-41fd-b082-bb042b9717b4.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nwhere every square is a cell complex morphism: some are images under K of morphisms in Top2, others like (1, \u03b1) and (1, \u03b2) are cell complex morphisms by definition. The very bottom square is the cell complex morphism referred to as \u03c6 in Proposition 7.1. We can compose the whole diagram together, using both vertical and horizontal composition of cell complex morphisms (see Proposition 4.8), to demonstrate that (1A, \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b1) does have the structure of a cell complex morphism. 7.6. Proposition. The definition of pushforward given in Definition 4.6 is the same as the general definition applied to CellCx as the category of left maps for the awfs (UK, E). Proof. Let (f, \u03b1) be a cell complex, and write (g\u2217f, g\u2217\u03b1) for the pushforward given by the general definition. Write \u03b2 for the structure map of the cell complex given by Definition 4.6; we need to show that \u03b2 = g\u2217\u03b1. Firstly, it is clear that g\u2217\u03b1\u25e6g\u2217f = \u03b2 \u25e6g\u2217f\u2014 this is one half of the neccessary identity. Also, it is clear from the definition of \u03b2 that (g, f\u2217g) has a cell complex morphism structure. This means that\nwhich is the other half of the identity.\n# 8. The universal property\nWe now have an awfs (UK, E) which we wish to compare with the awfs produced by the small object argument. One could take the approach of directly examining the two\ncomonads; if you draw pictures of both it becomes clear they are essentially the same. However, in the remainder of this paper we will use a different approach in which we exhibit a universal property of CellCx and compare it to the universal property established by Garner for the small object argument. The author feels that this approach\u2014while less efficient\u2014is more illuminating, as it expresses the universality of the cell complex category construction and thus helps us to see why it is a natural way to build an awfs. There is a canonical functor \u03b7: J \u2192CellCx over Top2, given by assigning each map in J its canonical height one, single-cell complex structure. The pair of CellCx and \u03b7 is universal among functors from J to categories of left maps over Top2, with respect to the composition preserving functors between left map categories (which are exactly morphisms of awfs\u2014see [Garner, 2009]). To make this work, we need to be sure that composition in an arbitrary left map category is sufficiently well behaved; we begin by proving two lemmas that express this. 8.1. Lemma. For any awfs (L, R), the composition rule in L-Map is strictly associative. Proof. Given three composable left maps, (f, \u03b1), (g, \u03b2) and (h, \u03b3), we obtain two left map structures on hgf given by the two ways of composing, namely \u03b3 \u2022 (\u03b2 \u2022 \u03b1) and (\u03b3 \u2022 \u03b2) \u2022 \u03b1. The structure maps for these are both shown, using dotted arrows, in the following diagram:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/d1cd/d1cd027a-9cc7-444b-895e-5018467296c3.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Using two naturality squares for \u00b5 (marked by the little squares in the diagram) and the multiplication law, we can factor both structure maps through MRR(hgf), and hence reduce the problem to that of comparing the map</div>\nM(M(M(1, h), h) \u25e6M(M(1, g) \u25e6\u03b1, 1) \u25e6\u03b2, 1)\n# (which is marked in the diagram as \u03c8) with the composite M(M(M(1, hg) \u25e6\u03b1, 1), 1) \u25e6M(M(1, h) \u25e6\u03b2, 1).\nBy the functoriality of M, this reduces to considering\nM(M(1, h), h) \u25e6M(M(1, g) \u25e6\u03b1, 1) = M(M(1, hg) \u25e6\u03b1, h) = M(M(1, hg) \u25e6\u03b1, 1) \u25e6M(M(1, h))\nand the two dotted composites in the diagram are the same.\nThe second lemma will prove what we will call the stacking property of left maps; it is absolutely vital in what follows because it justifies the requirement for cell complexes to be proper sequences. Stacking allows you to take a left map which is defined as a composite of colimits and move the individual elements of the colimits about without altering the left map structure. Since a cell complex is essentially defined as a composite of colimits, this says we can move cells in between strata freely; hence every potential cell complex can be reordered to make it proper\u2014and properness defines a natural normal form for cell complexes which hugely simplifies the definition.\n8.2. Lemma. For any awfs (L, R), the composition rule in L-Map is well behave with respect to coproducts and pushforwards in the following way: given f : A \u2192A\u2032 an g : B \u2192B\u2032 equipped with left map structures \u03b1 and \u03b2, and maps a: A \u2192X and b: B \u2192 X, there is an isomorphism of left maps\n# ([a, b]\u2217(f + g), [a, b]\u2217(\u03b1 + \u03b2)) \u223c= (((a\u2217f) \u25e6b)\u2217g, ((a\u2217f) \u25e6b)\u2217\u03b2) \u2022 (a\u2217f, a\u2217\u03b1).\n8.3. Remark. The proposition basically says that f and g can be \u2018glued on\u2019 to X in any order, or simultaneously by taking a coproduct first, and it makes no difference to the resulting left map. In the form of a picture:\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/a17d/a17dbb78-4fdc-433c-9ce7-b93048666bbd.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The left map on the left hand side is constructed using</div>\nwhile the left map on the right hand side is constructed using the two pushout squares in the diagram\nwhile the left map on the right hand side is constructed using the two pushout squares in the diagram\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/b0e6/b0e67608-2347-4818-be61-c3171a84257b.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n# and then composing.\nand then composing. The first thing to note is that Y and W have exactly the same universal property; we are thus able to choose pushouts in such a way that Y = W. Furthermore, if we make this choice, the underlying maps of the left maps we are comparing are identical. So if we check that the structure maps are equal, with this choice of pushout objects, then for any other choice the left maps we obtain will be isomorphic. We will now write h: X \u2192W for the underlying map; we have two structure maps W \u2192Mh and we wish to show they are equal. Using the universal property of W, it is sufficient to show the maps X \u2192Mh, A\u2032 \u2192 Mh and B\u2032 \u2192Mh that make up these structure maps agree. The X \u2192Mh parts are both just Lh, so they are easy. Showing that the other two parts agree can be done with two simple diagram chases. First, to simplify notation, we will start writing g\u2032 for ((a\u2217f) \u25e6b)\u2217g, and f \u2032 for a\u2217f; we will also write \u03b1\u2032 for the pushforward structure map on f \u2032 and \u03b2\u2032 for the one on g\u2032. Next, we note that the map [a, b]\u2032 can be written as [g\u2032a\u2032, b\u2032], using the universal property of W. Now consider the diagram\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/ecd5/ecd5a4e7-bf0b-436f-b9fe-7c436e1e8404.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nTwo straightforward chases show that (\u03b2\u2032 \u2022 \u03b1\u2032) \u25e6g\u2032 \u25e6a\u2032 = M(a, g\u2032a\u2032) \u25e6\u03b1 and that (\u03b2\u2032 \u2022 \u03b1\u2032) \u25e6b\u2032 = M(b, b\u2032) \u25e6\u03b2. We then factor M(a, g\u2032a\u2032) through M(iA, i\u2032 A) and factor M(b, b\u2032) through M(iB, i\u2032 B), the two inclusion maps to the coproduct. Then using the fact that, by definition of (\u03b1, \u03b2), M(iA, i\u2032 A) \u25e6\u03b1 = (\u03b1 + \u03b2) \u25e6i\u2032 A and M(iB, i\u2032 B) \u25e6\u03b2 = (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u25e6i\u2032 B, it is clear that (\u03b2\u2032 \u2022 \u03b1\u2032) and [a, b]\u2217(\u03b1 + \u03b2) agree on both A\u2032 and B\u2032. The universal property of CellCx with respect to J now follows without too much difficulty.\n8.4. Proposition. For any awfs (L, R) and functor F : J \u2192L-Map over Top2, there is a unique F \u2032: CellCx \u2192L-Map over Top2 which satisfies F = F \u2032 \u25e6\u03b7 and preserve composition.\nProof. What can we say about such a map? Firstly, it automatically preserves colimits; this follows from a standard argument, based on the fact that the forgetful functors are conservative and preserve colimits themselves. Secondly, we claim that it automatically preserves pushforwards, meaning that for any cell complex (f, \u03b1) and appropriate g, we have F \u2032(g\u2217f, g\u2217\u03b1) = g\u2217F \u2032(f, \u03b1). Since (g, f\u2217g) is a the underlying map of a cell complex morphism, by functoriality of F \u2032 it is a morphism of coalgebras for L. This means that F \u2032(g\u2217\u03b1) \u25e6f\u2217g = M(g, f\u2217g) \u25e6F \u2032\u03b1, and we know the latter is g\u2217(F \u2032\u03b1) \u25e6f\u2217g; this shows the two morphisms from the codomain of f to M(g\u2217f) are equal. It is trivial to show the two morphisms from the codomain of g to M(g\u2217f) are equal, so by the pushout property, the two left map structures are equal. These properties allow us to see that for any stratum (X, S), the image F \u2032(X, S) is determined entirely, since a stratum is just a pushforward of a coproduct of objects of J , and F \u2032 must take the objects of J , considered as cell complexes, to their images under F. Furthermore, any cell complex is the composite of all its strata; thus if F \u2032 is to preserve composition it will be determined completely by F. So we have essentially constructed a single possible candidate F \u2032; now we must check that it preserves all composites, not just the ones given by proper connected sequences of strata. But using Lemma 8.1 and Lemma 8.2, we can take any composite of cell complexes and move the individual cells between strata without effecting the image of the composite under F \u2032; therefore F \u2032 does indeed preserve composition and we are done.\n# 9. The main result\nWe are writing (L, R) for the awfs that is generated from J using Richard Garner\u2019s smal object argument. This is the object we really care about; we want to understand th coalgebras of L. This awfs has a certain universal property with respect to J :\n9.1. Definition. Given a small category I over C2, an awfs (L, R) on C is free with respect to I if there is a morphism \u03b7: I \u2192L-Map over C2 such that for any other awfs (L\u2032, R\u2032) on C and functor F : I \u2192L\u2032-Map over C2, there is a unique awfs morphism \u03b1: (L, R) \u2192(L\u2032, R\u2032) such that F = \u03b1\u2217\u25e6\u03b7. (The functor \u03b1\u2217: L-Map \u2192L\u2032-Map is the lifting of \u03b1, as a comonad morphism, to the categories of coalgebras.) In his paper [Garner, 2009], Garner both constructs (L, R) and proves that it is indeed free with respect to J . In this section we will show the same of our awfs (UK, E); then, since it is a universal property, the two awfs will be shown to be isomorphic. We have already done the hard work\u2014by the following lemma, the universal property of CellCx implies that (UK, E) is free with respect to J .

We note that this lemma is a special case of Lemma 6.9 in [Riehl, 2011a].\n9.2. Lemma. Given two awfs, (L, R) and (L\u2032, R\u2032), awfs morphisms (L, R) \u2192(L\u2032, R\u2032) are in bijection with functors L-Map \u2192L\u2032-Map over C2 that preserve the composition of left maps. Proof. First, assume we have an awfs morphism \u03c7: (L, R) \u2192(L\u2032, R\u2032). In particular, this is a comonad morphism L \u2192L\u2032, and this means it lifts to a functor \u02dc\u03c7: L-Map \u2192L\u2032-Map over C2. If (f, \u03b1) is an L-coalgebra, its image under \u02dc\u03c7 is given by (f, \u03c7f \u25e6\u03b1)\u2014this is the standard way of lifting a comonad morphism to the categories of coalgebras. We will check that \u02dc\u03c7 preserves composition of coalgebras, that is, that \u02dc\u03c7(f, \u03b1) \u2022 \u02dc\u03c7(g, \u03b2) = \u02dc\u03c7 \ufffd (f, \u03b1) \u2022 (g, \u03b2) \ufffd . This is a diagram chase which proceeds as follows:\n= \u00b5\u2032 gf \u25e6M\u2032(\u03c7gf, 1) \u25e6\u03c7R(gf) \u25e6M(M(1, g) \u25e6\u03b1, 1) \u25e6\u03b2 = \u00b5\u2032 gf \u25e6M\u2032(\u03c7gf, 1) \u25e6M\u2032(M(1, g) \u25e6\u03b1, 1) \u25e6\u03c7g \u25e6\u03b2 = \u00b5\u2032 gf \u25e6M\u2032(M\u2032(1, g) \u25e6\u03c7f \u25e6\u03b1, 1) \u25e6\u03c7g \u25e6\u03b2\n= \u00b5\u2032 gf \u25e6M\u2032(\u03c7gf, 1) \u25e6\u03c7R(gf) \u25e6M(M(1, g) \u25e6\u03b1, 1) \u25e6\u03b2 = \u00b5\u2032 gf \u25e6M\u2032(\u03c7gf, 1) \u25e6M\u2032(M(1, g) \u25e6\u03b1, 1) \u25e6\u03c7g \u25e6\u03b2\n= \u00b5\u2032 gf \u25e6M\u2032(M\u2032(1, g) \u25e6\u03c7f \u25e6\u03b1, 1) \u25e6\u03c7g \u25e6\u03b2\nwhere the first step uses the fact that \u03c7 is a comonad morphism, the second step uses naturality and the third step uses functoriality and naturality. Now we start with a functor F : L-Map \u2192L\u2032-Map over C2 and we assume it preserves composition. We use F to define a natural transformation \u03b3 : M \u2192M\u2032L by writing the image of the coalgebra (Lf, \u03b4f) as (Lf, \u03b3f). Then we define the natural transformation \u03c7: M \u2192M\u2032 by \u03c7f = M\u2032(1, Rf)\u25e6\u03b3f. This is the standard way of constructing a comonad morphism from a functor between the categories of coalgebras; hence (1, \u03c7) is a comonad morphism L \u2192L\u2032. We will show that at the same time, (\u03c7, 1) is a monad morphism R \u2192R\u2032, and that hence \u03c7 is an awfs morphism (L, R) \u2192(L\u2032, R\u2032). First, it is quick to check that R\u2032f \u25e6\u03c7f = Rf; consider\nR\u2032f \u25e6M\u2032(1, Rf) \u25e6\u03b3f = Rf \u25e6R\u2032Lf \u25e6\u03b3f = Rf\nwhere the first step follows from the properties of M\u2032(1, Rf) and the second uses the fact that \u03b3f is the structure map for a coalgebra. The other identity \u03c7 must satisfy in order to be a monad morphism is shown by the following diagram chase:\n= M\u2032(1, RRf) \u25e6\u00b5\u2032 (LRf\u25e6Lf) \u25e6M\u2032(M\u2032(1, LRf) \u25e6\u03b3f, 1) \u25e6\u03b3Rf = \u00b5\u2032 f \u25e6M\u2032(M\u2032(1, RRf), RRf) \u25e6M\u2032(M\u2032(1, LRf) \u25e6\u03b3f, 1) \u25e6\u03b3Rf = \u00b5\u2032 f \u25e6M\u2032(\u03c7f, RRf) \u25e6\u03b3Rf = \u00b5\u2032 f \u25e6M\u2032(\u03c7f, 1) \u25e6M\u2032(1, RRf) \u25e6\u03b3Rf = \u00b5\u2032 f \u25e6M\u2032(\u03c7f, 1) \u25e6\u03c7Rf\nin which we have used the fact that \u00b5f = (\u03b4Rf \u2022 \u03b4f) \u25e6M(1, RRf), the assumption that F preserves composition, and the definition of composition of L\u2032-maps. Since the correspondence we have demonstrated between awfs and composition preserving functors is a restriction of the standard natural isomorphism between comonad maps and functors on coalgebras, it is therefore a bijection and we are done.\n9.3. Corollary. The awfs (UK, E) is free with respect to J .\nSince they share this universal property, the awfs (UK, E) and (L, R) must be isomorphic. Thus we are finally able to prove the main result of the paper.\n9.4. Theorem. Every map with a left-map structure with respect to (L, R) is in th class J -cell.\n Theorem. Every map with a left-map structure with respect to (L, R) is in the  J -cell.\nProof. The category CellCx which we defined is equivalent over Top2 to the category of coalgebras for the comonad UK, because the adjunction is comonadic. We have also shown that (UK, E) and (L, R) are isomorphic as awfs. Hence UK and L are isomorphic as comonads; so they have equivalent categories of coalgebras. Thus CellCx is equivalent over Top2 to the category L-Map of left-maps. Since, as we showed in Proposition 4.9, the image of the functor U is precisely J -cell, every map with a left-map structure is in J -cell.\n# 10. Further thoughts\nWhat we have done applies only to a single awfs in a single category. Regardless of the fact that it is arguably the most important awfs under study at the moment, this is still quite a limitation. However, in proving this result for a very specific case, we have demonstrated a technique that will, in the author\u2019s view, quite easily extend to many other examples. There are many parts of the proof where the argument would have worked equally well for any class of maps in a category with all small limits and colimits. It seems likely that the construction of CellCx will work for any category J ; to consider it in a more generalised context we would want to hone in on what it really does. It seems to consist of three steps: the first is to freely complete J under colimits. This is a well understood 2-categorical completion which results in the category of presheaves over J . The second step is free completion under pushforwards, which produces the category of strata. The third step is then to complete freely under composition, resulting in the entire category of cell complexes. There is a very close analogy between these three steps and the three steps of Garner\u2019s small object argument which are outlined in [Garner, 2009]. One important feature of the definition of cell complexes given in this paper is the fact that they are countable sequences of strata. This is a substantial limitation on the cardinalities involved, and one that is only possible because of special properties enjoyed by the category Top and the class of maps J ; they are the same finiteness conditions that allow the standard small object argument to be terminated within \u03c9 steps. In a general\n\n\nsetting, one would need to check similar conditions, and in some cases the ordinal number of iterations required may be larger. In these cases, the definition of cell complex will be slightly more complicated because they will be ordinal sequences of strata with length greater than \u03c9. However, in the author\u2019s view, this extra complication in the definition will not be a serious difficulty. The largest challenges faced by an attempt to generalise this argument will come in the case where the maps of J are not all strict monomorphisms. Many of the definitions and propositions above are predicated quite strongly on the assumption that \u2018adding cells\u2019 to a complex is always a matter of \u2018adding\u2019; however, if a cell shape in J were not monic, the pushout we would construct to glue it onto a complex would involve quotienting\u2014adding a cell could be a reduction. This may seem very counter-intuitive, but there are important examples of awfs where exactly this behaviour would occur: in particular, most of the awfs defined on (different strengths of) n-categories have as their highest dimensional cell shape a non-monic map that identifies two morphisms of the highest dimension. In this case, the definitions in Section 4 would need to be very carefully reconsidered. For example, if a cell shape is epimorphic, one could have any number of cells which make no difference to the underlying morphism\u2014most morphisms would have infinitely many non-isomorphic cell complex structures. In particular, the forgetful functor U would not be conservative, and hence the proof would fail as it currently stands.\n# References\n[Barthel, Riehl, 2012] T. Barthel and E.
