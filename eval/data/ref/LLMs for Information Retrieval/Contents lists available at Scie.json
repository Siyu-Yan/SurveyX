More importantly, the popularity of bibliometric analysis in business research is not a fad but rather a reflection of its utility for (1) handling large volumes of scientific data, and (2) producing high research impact.  Scholars use bibliometric analysis for a variety of reasons, such as to uncover emerging trends in article and journal performance, collabo\u00ad ration patterns, and research constituents, and to explore the intellectual structure of a specific domain in the extant literature (Donthu, Kumar, Pandey, & Lim, 2021a; Verma & Gustafsson, 2020; Donthu et al., 2020c).

In other words, bibliometric analysis is useful for deciphering and mapping the cumulative scientific knowledge and evolutionary nuances of wellestablished fields by making sense of large volumes of unstructured data in rigorous ways. Therefore, bibliometric studies that are well done can build firm foundations for advancing a field in novel and meaningful ways\u2014it enables and empowers scholars to (1) gain a one-stop over\u00ad view, (2) identify knowledge gaps, (3) derive novel ideas for investi\u00ad gation, and (4) position their intended contributions to the field.  Notwithstanding its merits, bibliometric analysis remains relatively new in business research, and in many instances, its deployment does not make full use of its potential. This occurs when bibliometric studies rely on a limited set of bibliometric data and techniques and provide only a piecemeal understanding of the field under study (e.g., perfor\u00ad mance analysis without science mapping\u2014e.g., Brown, Park, & Pitt, 2020). It is important to note that an authoritative guide to bibliometric analysis in business research remains absent, which poses as a signifi\u00ad cant challenge for business scholars who wish to learn more about the bibliometric methodology and its application for business research in a\nholistic yet easy-to-digest manner. Though authoritative guides on sys\u00ad tematic literature reviews are available (e.g., Palmatier, Houston, & Hulland, 2018; Snyder, 2019), they do not provide adequate breadth and depth on the bibliometric methodology.  Given the aforementioned gaps, this paper aims to offer (1) an overview of the bibliometric methodology and (2) step-by-step guidelines for conducting bibliometric analysis for business research. In particular, this paper introduces bibliometric analysis to business scholars, wherein its fundamentals, techniques, and procedures, with exemplars and ra\u00ad tionales, are provided. The contributions of this paper are manifold. First, the paper, which presents an overview of bibliometric analysis and the guidelines on how to conduct it, can help business scholars to learn about the bibliometric methodology and to use that understanding to evaluate specific fields in the extant literature with large bibliometric data and corpus. Second, the paper, which provides several suggestions regarding the different techniques that can be used for bibliometric analysis and when they should be used, can widen the perspective of business scholars on the alternatives and rationales for using the different variants of bibliometric analysis. As a whole, this paper en\u00ad hances understanding of the bibliometric methodology for business research with clarity and rigor, and thus, paves the way for business scholars to use bibliometric analysis appropriately, meaningfully, and rigorously in their future research.  The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The paper begins with an overview of bibliometric analysis, followed by a toolbox of available techniques for bibliometric analysis with accompanying guidelines on when to use them. Next, the paper delves into the different research metrics and clustering algorithms used in the network analysis of bib\u00ad liometric data. The paper then explains the process of conducting a bibliometric analysis before concluding with its final remarks on the limitations associated to bibliometrics. \n# 2.

Early discussion on bibliometrics  started in the 1950s (Wallin, 2005), which suggests that the bibliometric  methodology is not new. Yet, the proliferation of bibliometrics is fairly  recent, as seen through its growth in the fields of \u201cbusiness, manage\u00ad ment, and accounting,\u201d \u201ceconomics, econometrics, and finance,\u201d and  \u201csocial sciences\u201d on Scopus using \u201cbibliom*\u201d as a keyword in the \u201carticle  title, abstract, and keywords\u201d (see Fig. 1). Specifically, publications  using bibliometrics have grown over the years, with an average of 1021  publications in the last decade, which can be attributed to the growth of  scientific research itself. Yet, large bibliographic datasets have made  classic review methods cumbersome and impractical (Ramos-Rodr\u00edgue  & Ru\u00edz-Navarro, 2004). It is noteworthy that the emergence of scientific databases such as Scopus and Web of Science has made acquiring large volumes of bibliometric data relatively easy, and bibliometric software  such as Gephi, Leximancer, and VOSviewer enable the analysis of such  data in a very pragmatic way, thereby raising scholarly interest in bib\u00ad liometric analysis in recent times. Indeed, the bibliometric methodology  has been applied in a variety of fields in business research, including business strategy (Kumar, Surekha, Lim, Mangla, & Goyal, 2021),  electronic commerce (Kumar, Lim, Pandey, & Westland, 2021), finance  (Durisin & Puzone, 2009; Linnenluecke, Chen, Ling, Smith, & Zhu, 2017; Xu et al., 2018), human resources (Andersen, 2019), management (Ellegaard & Wallin, 2015; Zupic & \u02c7Cater, 2015), and marketing (Backhaus, L\u00fcgger, & Koch, 2011; Donthu, Kumar, Pandey, & Soni,  2020d; Donthu, Kumar, & Pattnaik, 2020b; Donthu, Kumar, Pattnaik, &  Lim, 2021; Hu, Song, & Guo, 2019; Samiee & Chabowski, 2012; Donthu  et al., 2020c), wherein the application of bibliometrics ranges from \net al., 2020c), wherein the application of bibliometrics ranges from studying publication to collaboration patterns and exploring the intel\u00ad lectual structure of the research field. Here, the research field can also manifest as journals. Indeed, the bibliometric methodology has been applied to provide retrospectives of journals (e.g., Journal of Business Research), which typically occur in milestone years (Donthu et al., 2020b).  At this juncture, it is important to compare bibliometric analysis with other frequently used review alternatives such as meta-analysis and systematic literature reviews. In essence, meta-analysis estimates (1) \u201cthe overall strength and direction of effects or relationships,\u201d and (2)\n\u201cthe across-study variance in the distribution of effect-size estimates and the factors that explain this variance\u201d (Aguinis, Pierce, Bosco, Dalton, & Dalton, 2011, p. 310), whereas systematic literature reviews, such as domain-, method-, and theory-based reviews, encapsulate the acquisi\u00ad tion, arrangement, and assessment of the extant literature using sys\u00ad tematic procedures (Palmatier et al., 2018; Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart, 2003), which are typically carried out manually (e.g., content and the\u00ad matic analyses) by scholars (Lahiri, Mukherjee, & Peng, 2020; Lim, Yap, & Makkar, 2021).  Similar to bibliometric analysis, meta-analysis is able to handle large amounts of literature and provides a nuanced summary of a given field, though the literature considered tend to be less diverse, and the het\u00ad erogeneity of existing studies and the existence of a publication bias can have an adverse effect on the validity of the results obtained via metaanalysis (Aguinis, Gottfredson, & Wright, 2011; Junni, Sarala, Taras, & Tarba, 2013). In contrast, systematic literature reviews using classic methods require a narrow scope of study and thus tend to include a lesser number of papers for review (e.g., between tens [e.g., 40] and low hundreds [e.g., 100\u2013300]) (Snyder, 2019). In that sense, systematic literature reviews are better suited for confined (e.g., customer engagement on social media) or niche research areas (e.g., social media influencer marketing). Unlike systematic literature reviews that tend to rely on qualitative techniques, which could be marred by interpretation bias from scholars across different academic backgrounds (MacCoun, 1998), bibliometric analysis and meta-analysis rely upon quantitative techniques and thus can avoid or mitigate that bias.  Since meta-analysis and bibliometric analysis are both quantitative in nature, the distinction between the two methods can be confusing to some scholars. To shed light on this distinction, business scholars should note that their quantitative methods are relatively different in terms of usage, though they can both handle large amounts of literature. Spe\u00ad cifically, meta-analysis concentrates on summarizing empirical evidence by analyzing the direction and strength of effects and relationships among variables and is \u201cuseful in addressing open research questions with data that are closer to definitive than those reported in any single primary study\u201d (Carney, Gedajlovic, Heugens, Van Essen, & Van Oos\u00ad terhout, 2011, p 438). It is performed to throw light on mixed empirical findings and boundary conditions. Thus, meta-analyses are often used as\n# & Makkar, 2021). \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Comparison of major review methods.</div>\nReview type \nGoal \nWhen to use \nWhen not to use \nScope \nDataset \nAnalysis \nBibliometric \nanalysis  \n\u2022 Summarizes large quantities of \nbibliometric data to present the \nstate of the intellectual structure \nand emerging trends of a \nresearch topic or field.  \n\u2022 When the scope of review is \nbroad.  \n\u2022 When the dataset is too large \nfor manual review.  \n\u2022 When the scope of review \nis specific.  \n\u2022 When the dataset is small \nand manageable enough \nthat its content can be \nmanually reviewed.  \n\u2022 Broad  \n\u2022 Large  \n\u2022 Quantitative \n(evaluation and \ninterpretation)  \n\u2022 Qualitative \n(interpretation \nonly) \nMeta-analysis  \n\u2022 Summarizes the empirical \nevidence of relationship between \nvariables while uncovering \nrelationships not studied in \nexisting studies.  \n\u2022 When the focus of review is to \nsummarize results rather than \nto engage with content, \nwhich may be broad or \nspecific.  \n\u2022 When studies in the field are \nhomogenous.  \n\u2022 When the number of \nhomogeneous studies \navailable is sufficiently high.  \n\u2022 When the number of \nhomogeneous studies \nremaining after removing low \nquality studies is sufficiently \nhigh.  \n\u2022 When studies in the field \nare heterogeneous.  \n\u2022 When the number of \nhomogenous studies is \nrelatively low.  \n\u2022 When the number of high- \nquality homogeneous \nstudies is relatively low.  \n\u2022 Broad  \n\u2022 Specific  \n\u2022 Large  \n\u2022 Small but \nadequate  \n\u2022 Quantitative \n(evaluation and \ninterpretation) \nSystematic \nliterature \nreview  \n\u2022 Summarizes and synthesizes the \nfindings of existing literature on \na research topic or field.  \n\u2022 When the scope of review is \nspecific.  \n\u2022 When the dataset is small and \nmanageable enough that its \ncontent can be manually \nreviewed.  \n\u2022 When the scope of review \nis broad.  \n\u2022 When the dataset is too \nlarge for manual review.  \n\u2022 Specific  \n\u2022 Small  \n\u2022 Qualitative \n(evaluation and \ninterpretation)  \ntheory extension tools (Combs, Ketchen, Crook, & Roth, 2011). In  contrast, bibliometric analysis summarizes the bibliometric and intel\u00ad lectual structure of a field by analyzing the social and structural re\u00ad lationships between different research constituents (e.g., authors,  countries, institutions, topics).  In summary, the use of any of the three review methods discussed  herein is dependent upon the goals of the review and the magnitude and  nature of the literature being reviewed. Nonetheless, these review  methods remain complementary to one another and they offer unique  advantages to scholars who are interested in using them. Table 1 pre\u00ad sents the methodological comparison of bibliometric analysis, meta-  analysis, and systematic literature reviews across different criteria to  help authors make informed decisions with respect to the selection of the  appropriate review method. \n# 3. The bibliometric analysis technique toolbox\nThe techniques for bibliometric analysis manifest across two cate\u00ad gories: (1) performance analysis and (2) science mapping. In essence, performance analysis accounts for the contributions of research constit\u00ad uents, whereas science mapping focuses on the relationships between research constituents. The next sub-sections sheds light on the tech\u00ad niques available for performance analysis and science mapping, which are illustrated in Fig. 2. \n# 3.1. Performance analysis\nPerformance analysis examines the contributions of research constit\u00ad uents to a given field (Cobo, L\u00b4opez-Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Herrera, 2011; Ramos-Rodr\u00edgue & Ru\u00edz-Navarro, 2004). The analysis, which is descriptive in nature, is the hallmark of bibliometric studies (Donthu, Reinartz, Kumar, & Pattnaik, 2020). Performance analysis can be found in most reviews, even in those that do not engage in science mapping, because it is a standard practice in reviews to present the performance of different research constituents (e.g., authors, institutions, countries, and journals) in the field, which is akin to the background or profile of participants that is typically presented in empirical research albeit more analytically. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/7b3e/7b3eb932-89b4-4eff-8248-bf3b10cc958e.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 2. The bibliometric analysis toolbox.</div>\nMyriad measures for performance analysis exist. The most prominent measures are the number of publications and citations per year or per research constituent, wherein publication is a proxy for productivity, whereas citation is a measure of impact and influence. Other measures such as citation per publication and h-index combines both citations and publications to measure the performance of research constituents. The analysis, despite being descriptive, recognizes the importance of different constituents in a research field. Table 2 presents a sample of metrics suitable for performance analysis. \n# 3.2. Science mapping \nScience mapping examines the relationships between research con\u00ad stituents (Baker, Kumar, & Pandey, 2021; Cobo et al., 2011; RamosRodr\u00edgue & Ru\u00edz-Navarro, 2004). The analysis pertains to the intellec\u00ad tual interactions and structural connections among research constitu\u00ad ents. The techniques for science mapping include citation analysis, cocitation analysis, bibliographic coupling, co-word analysis, and coauthorship analysis. Such techniques, when combined with network analysis, are instrumental in presenting the bibliometric structure and the intellectual structure of the research field (Baker, Pandey, Kumar, & Haldar, 2020; Tunger & Eulerich, 2018). Table 3 presents a summary of the different techniques for science mapping with focus on their usage and data considerations. \n# 3.2.1. Citation analysis\nCitation analysis is a basic technique for science mapping that operates on the assumption that citations reflect intellectual linkages between publications that are form when one publication cites the other (Appio, Cesaroni, & Di Minin, 2014). In this analysis, the impact of a publication is determined by the number of citations that it receives. The analysis enables the most influential publications in a research field to be ascertained. Though there are a variety of methods (e.g., network metrics) to determine the importance of publications in a research field,\nthe most objective and straightforward measure of its impact is its  citation (Pieters & Baumgartner, 2002; Stremersch, Verniers, & Verhoef,  2007). Therefore, using citations, one can analyze the most influential  publications in a research field to gain an understanding of the intel\u00ad lectual dynamics of that field. \n# 3.2.2. Co-citation analysis\nCo-citation analysis is a technique for science mapping that assumes publications that are cited together frequently are similar thematically (Hj\u00f8rland, 2013). The analysis can be used to reveal the intellectual structure of a research field (Rossetto, Bernardes, Borini, & Gattaz, 2018), such as its underlying themes (Liu, Yin, Liu, & Dunford, 2015). In a co-citation network, two publications are connected when they cooccur in the reference list of another publication. The benefit of using co-citation analysis is that, in addition to finding the most influential publications, business scholars can also discover thematic clusters. Here, the thematic clusters are derived based on the cited publications. How\u00ad ever, co-citation analysis concentrates only on highly-cited publications, and leaves publications that are recent or niche out of its thematic clusters. In that sense, co-citation analysis is suitable for business scholars who wish to uncover seminal publications and knowledge foundations. \n# 3.2.3. Bibliographic coupling\nBibliographic coupling is a technique for science mapping that operates on the assumption that two publications sharing common ref\u00ad erences are also similar in their content (Kessler, 1963; Weinberg, 1974). The analysis concentrates on the division of publications into thematic clusters based on shared references, and is best used within a specific timeframe (Zupic & \u02c7Cater, 2015). Here, the thematic clusters are formed based on the citing publications, and thus, recent and niche publications can gain visibility through bibliographic coupling (unlike co-citation analysis). In that sense, bibliographic coupling is suitable for business scholars who wish to uncover a broad spectrum of themes and its latest\nTable 2  Metrics for performance analysis.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Metrics for performance analysis.</div>\nments.

The analysis can therefore provide a representation of the present of the research field. \n# 3.2.4. Co-word analysis \nWhile the previous three techniques for science mapping focus on publications, the unit of analysis for co-word analysis is \u201cwords.\u201d In other words, unlike citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and biblio\u00ad graphic coupling, which employs either cited or citing publications as a focal point or a proxy, the co-word analysis is a technique that examines the actual content of the publication itself. The words in a co-word analysis are often derived from \u201cauthor keywords\u201d, and in its absence, notable words can also be extracted from \u201carticle titles,\u201d \u201cabstracts,\u201d and \u201cfull texts\u201d for the analysis (e.g., Baker, Kumar, & Pandey, 2020; Burton,\n# \u201cfull texts\u201d for the analysis (e.g., Baker, Kumar, & Pandey, 2020; Burton, Kumar, & Pandey, 2020; Donthu, Gremler, Kumar, & Pattnaik, 2020; Emich, Kumar, Lu, Norder, & Pandey, 2020; Liu, Mai, & MacDonald,\n2019). Similar to co-citation analysis, the co-word analysis assumes that  words that frequently appear together have a thematic relationship with  one another.  The usage of words as a unit of analysis, however, has its downsides.  For example, certain words are used in multiple contexts, and thus, (re)  reading of publications becomes necessary to understand the meaning of \nthe relationships between words. Besides that, some words can be very general (e.g., subject field names\u2014e.g., advertising), and thus, it may be challenging to assign them to any one thematic cluster.  To mitigate the potential downsides of co-word analysis, business scholars are encouraged to use the analysis strategically. Here, two recommendations are provided. First, a co-word analysis can be used as a supplement to enrich understanding about the thematic clusters derived from co-citation analysis or bibliographic coupling because the themes formed through the commonalities in publications tend to be relatively general (Chang, Huang, & Lin, 2015), and thus, the use of coword analysis can help business scholars to elaborate on the content of each thematic cluster. Second, a co-word analysis can be used to forecast future research in the field, which can be happen when notable \u201cwords\u201d from the publication\u2019s implications and future research directions are used in the analysis. In that sense, the co-word analysis is suitable for business scholars who wish to enrich their interpretations of co-citation analysis (past) or bibliographic coupling (present) and to predict forth\u00ad coming trajectories. The co-word analysis can therefore provide a\n3.2.5. Co-authorship analysis  Co-authorship analysis examines the interactions among scholars in  a research field. Since co-authorship is a formal way of intellectual  collaboration among scholars (Acedo, Barroso, Casanueva, & Galan,  2006; Cisneros, Ibanescu, Keen, Lobato-Calleros, & Niebla-Zatarain,  2018), it is therefore important to understand how scholars interact  amongst themselves (including associated author attributes such as  affiliated institutions and countries). With the increasing methodolog\u00ad ical and theoretical complexity in research, collaborations among  scholars have become a commonplace (Acedo et al., 2006). In fact,  collaborations among scholars can lead to improvements in  research\u2014for example, contributions from different scholars can  contribute to greater clarity and richer insights (Tahamtan, Safipour  Afshar, & Ahamdzadeh, 2016). Here, scholars that collaborate form a  network known as \u201cinvisible collages,\u201d whose study can help develop  the undertakings in the research field (Crane, 1969). For example, the  analysis can shed light on clustered research among scholars from a  particular region, and such insights can be used to justify and spark new  research among scholars in underrepresented regions. The analysis also  enables collaborations to be mapped across different periods of time,  thereby enabling scholars to review the trajectory of intellectual  development against collaboration networks, while equipping prospec\u00ad tive scholars with valuable information to reach out and collaborate  with established and trending scholars in the research field. \n# 4. The bibliometric analysis enrichment toolbox \nBuilding on the core techniques of bibliometric analysis, this section presents the add-ons that can augmented to enrich the outcomes of the analysis techniques applied in bibliometric studies. In total, three enrichment pathways predicated on network analysis are suggested in the form of network metrics, clustering, and visualization. \n# 4.1. Network metrics\nNetwork metrics can be used to enrich the assessment of bibliometric analysis. In particular, network metrics shed light on the relative importance of research constituents (e.g., authors, institutions, coun\u00ad tries), which may not necessarily be reflected through publications or citations. Importantly, network metrics are commonly employed to enrich the discussion of research fields in bibliometric studies (Ander\u00ad sen, 2019; Andrikopoulos & Economou, 2016; Baker, Kumar, and Patt\u00ad naik, 2020; Cisneros et al., 2018), and thus, they represent a legitimate method for enriching bibliometric assessments. To provide greater clarity, several exemplars of network metrics are provided (e.g., degree of centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, and PageRank), along with a sample table of publication ranking that can be curated across different centrality measures (see Table 4). Specifically:  \n Degree of centrality refers to the number of relational ties a research constituent has in a network. For example, if an author in a coauthorship network has worked with four different authors, then his or her degree of centrality would be four. This is by far the simplest measure of centrality as it relies on the numerical count of relational ties. A variant of this measure is the weighted degree of centrality, which is calculated by multiplying the total number of relational ties with the strength of each tie. For example, if Author A has written two publications with Author B and one each with Author C and Author D, then Author A\u2019s degree of centrality will be three but his or her weighted degree of centrality would be four. Though the simplicity of these measures is an advantage in itself, the measures do not present information on what role a research con\u00ad stituent plays in the research field.  \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Sample ranking for publications according to different centrality measures.</div>\nArticle \nDegree of \ncentrality \nWeighted \ndegree of \ncentrality \nBetweenness \ncentrality \nEigen- \ncentrality \nAdams and \nFerreira (2009) \n280 \n280 \n0.001228 \n1.000000 \nCarter et al. \n(2010) \n157 \n157 \n0.002459 \n0.429861 \nCampbell and \nM\u00ednguez-Vera \n(2008) \n157 \n157 \n0.000973 \n0.576924 \nFarrell and Hersch \n(2005) \n125 \n125 \n0.000383 \n0.79642 \nRose (2007) \n103 \n103 \n0.000468 \n0.547304 \nBear et al.

Degree of centrality = the number of relational ties an article or a research constituent (e.g., author, country, institution, journal) has in a network. Weighted degree of centrality = the total number of relational ties an article or a research constituent (e.g., author, country, institution, journal) has in a network multiply the strength of each tie. Betweenness centrality = a node\u2019s ability to carry information between unconnected groups of nodes in a network, wherein each node represents an article or a research constituent (e.g., author, country, institution, journal). Eigen-centrality = the importance of the node in the network that is responsible for transmitting information to other highly-connected nodes, wherein each node represents an article or a research constituent (e.g., author, country, institution, journal). \n\u2022 Betweenness centrality refers to a node\u2019s ability to carry information between unconnected groups of nodes, wherein each node represents a research constituent. Though betweenness centrality is more complex than the degree of centrality, the measure does present in\u00ad formation about the role played by the research constituent in a network. In particular, betweenness centrality is measured by calculating the total number of shortest paths passing through a particular node (\u03b4v,w(u)) and dividing it by the total number of shortest paths in the entire network (\u03b4v,w). \nB(u) = \u2211\u03b4v,w(u) \u03b4v,w    \n\u2022 Eigenvector centrality is higher for nodes that are connected to other  highly-connected nodes, wherein each node represents a research  constituent. Specifically, a higher value of eigenvector centrality is a  reflection of the importance of the node in the network that is \n# responsible for transmitting information to other highly-connected nodes. This network metric is calculated as \n# responsible for transmitting information to other highly-connected nodes. This network metric is calculated as  = 1 \u2211 x\nwhere, M(i) is the set of neighbours of i, and \u03bb is a constant.\n\u2022 Closeness centrality refers to the capability of nodes to carry infor\u00ad mation effectively by being closer to other nodes in the network. The sum of distance of such nodes from other nodes in the network in\u00ad dicates the relative ease for these nodes to carry information effectively.   \u2022 PageRank analysis is an alternative measure of a publication\u2019s impact (Ding et al., 2009). Though PageRank was initially designed to pri\u00ad oritize web pages in a keyword search, the method has found its way to bibliometrics. In particular, PageRank can be used to calculate the prestige of publications that have an influence on the research field by influencing highly-cited publications despite not being highly cited themselves. In that sense, a publication with a high PageRank is deemed as \u201chigh quality\u201d and thus a \u201cmust cite\u201d among highly-cited publications. In addition, PageRank can also be applied in clustering, which will be discussed in the next section, to reveal the themes in a review domain. The formula for calculating PageRank is given as follows: \nwhere A is the publication cited by highly-cited publications T1, T2, T3, \u2026, Tn, C(Ti) is the citations of publication Ti, PR(Ti) is the publication\u2019s\nwhere A is the publication cited by highly-cited publications T1, T2, T3,  \u2026, Tn, C(Ti) is the citations of publication Ti, PR(Ti) is the publication\u2019s \n# Table 5\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Sample table for publication rankings according to PageRank.</div>\nSample table for publication rankings according to PageRank.  \nArticle \nPageRank \nGlobal \ncitations \nLocal \ncitations \nAgrawal and Knoeber (2001) \n0.081163 \n289 \n15 \nVan der Walt and Ingley (2003) \n0.062236 \n117 \n47 \nAdams and Ferreira (2009) \n0.061156 \n738 \n280 \nFarrell and Hersch (2005) \n0.058248 \n267 \n125 \nArfken et al.

PageRank = a metric derived from the ci\u00ad tations that an article receives from other highly-cited articles, which indicates the prestige of that article. Global citations = the citations that an article re\u00ad ceives as is (without filtration). Local citations = the citations that an article receives from other articles in the review corpus only (with filtration\u2014i.e., the review domain). Local citations are generally lower and can never be higher than global citations, wherein the occurrence of the latter is an indication of an erroneous entry. The comparison of global and local citations can enrich un\u00ad derstanding of research impact and influence as they reveal the actual or true state of affairs (e.g., articles with high global citations demonstrate impact and influence across disciplines, whereas articles with high local citations indicate impact and influence within the discipline). \nPageRank, d is a dampening factor, and N is the size of the network. Table 5 presents a sample of publication rankings according to PageRank. \n# 4.2. Clustering\nClustering is another enrichment technique for bibliometric analysis whose primary goal is to create thematic or social clusters (depending upon the type of analysis being conducted). Curating network clusters and observing their development can be useful for understanding how a research field manifests and develops. For example, the thematic clus\u00ad ters created using co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling shed light on the major themes underpinning the intellectual structure and their development over time in the research field. Several techniques can be used for clustering such as exploratory factor analysis, hierar\u00ad chical clustering, Island algorithm, Louvain method, multidimensional scaling, and simple centers algorithm, which can be complementary to one another (Zupic & \u02c7Cater, 2015). \n# 4.3. Visualization\nThe use of bibliometric analysis often goes hand in hand with network visualization software, which ranges from entirely graphical user interface-based software such as VOSviewer (van Eck & Waltman, 2010) to command-based software such as Bibliometrix package in R (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017). Other prominently-used bibliometric soft\u00ad ware includes Bibexcel, Pajek, Gephi, SciMat, Sci2, and UCINET. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 present random exemplars of network visualization using VOSviewer and Gephi, respectively.  Most network visualization software are open source and free, and thus, the choice of software reside with scholars. Each software has its own pros and cons. For example, though Pajek and UCINET have many features, their speed of development is slower as compared to software such as Gephi and R. The flexibility of the generated network is another challenge. For example, in a network generated using VOSviewer, different forms of the same words cannot be merged, while the same can be done using Gephi. One method to address this issue is to use biblio\u00ad metric analysis and network visualization software in combination with one another. In fact, many bibliometric studies do take such a comple\u00ad mentary approach to leverage on software strengths and to overcome software shortcomings (e.g., Baker et al., 2020a; Donthu, Kumar, Pan\u00ad dey, & Gupta, 2021; Xu et al., 2018). Therefore, considerations per\u00ad taining to software features and the flexibility of the resulting network should be taken into account when making a decision to choose a bib\u00ad liometric or a combination of bibliometric software for analysis and visualization. \n# 5. The bibliometric analysis procedure\nIn this section, the paper presents the steps for conducting biblio\u00ad metric analysis along with the general guidelines to be followed. Fig. 5 presents an illustration of the steps while Table 6 presents the guidelines for bibliometric analysis with a focus on the specific (questions) rec\u00ad ommendations regarding what scholars should ask themselves in each of these steps. \n# 5.1. Step 1: Define the aims and scope of the bibliometric study\nThis first step is to define the aims and scope of the bibliometric  study, which must occur before the selection of bibliometric analysis  techniques and the gathering of bibliometric data. Doing the latter  before the former is risky as unsuitable aims and scope can render bib\u00ad liometric analysis useless, and thus, wasting precious resources that  could be better invested with careful planning.  The aims of a bibliometric study should relate to a retrospection of the  performance and science of a research field. In terms of performance, \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0c9f/0c9f71a3-88d6-4d84-93a7-c49980747058.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\nFig. 3. Example of co-word (keyword co-occurrence) network visualization using VOSviewer. Note(s): Each node in a network represents an entity (e.g., article,  author, country, institution, keyword, journal), and in the case of Fig. 3, a keyword, wherein: (1) the size of the node indicates the occurrence of the keyword (i.e., the  number of times that the keyword occurs), (2) the link between the nodes represents the co-occurrence between keywords (i.e., keywords that co-occur or occur together),  (3) the thickness of the link signals the occurrence of co-occurrences between keywords (i.e., the number of times that the keywords co-occur or occur together), (4) the  bigger the node, the greater the occurrence of the keyword, and (5) the thicker the link between nodes, the greater the occurrence of the co-occurrences between keywords. Each  color represents a thematic cluster, wherein the nodes and links in that cluster can be used to explain the theme\u2019s (cluster\u2019s) coverage of topics (nodes) and the relationships  (links) between the topics (nodes) manifesting under that theme (cluster). \nbibliometric studies are often set out to unpack the prolific research constituents in the research field, which may include authors, in\u00ad stitutions, countries, and journals. In terms of science, bibliometric studies are usually designed to reveal the bibliometric structure that en\u00ad capsulates the networks between research constituents contributing to the intellectual structure that is founded upon clusters of pertinent themes in the research field.  The scope for study should generally be large enough to warrant bibliometric analysis because the analysis is designed to handle large volumes of bibliometric data (Ramos-Rodr\u00edgue & Ru\u00edz-Navarro, 2004). To determine whether the scope of the study is adequately large, scholars can review the number of papers that avail on the intended research field for study. If there are considerable hundreds (e.g., 500 or more) or thousands of papers, then that research field can be considered to be large enough to warrant the use of bibliometric analysis. If there are only tens (e.g., 50) or low hundreds (e.g., 100\u2013300) of papers, then the research field is considered to be small and thus do not warrant the use of bibliometric analysis, as forcing the analysis on this small corpus would be an overkill. In this case, alternative review methods such as meta-analysis and systematic literature reviews may be better suited. \n# 5.2. Step 2: Choose the techniques for bibliometric analysis\nThe second step is to design the bibliometric study, wherein the techniques for bibliometric analysis are chosen to meet the aims and scope of the study in the first step. One challenge that scholars often encounter at this stage is the decision of whether to choose a technique based on the bibliometric data sought or to choose a technique first and\nthen prepare the bibliometric data according to that selected technique thereafter. To overcome this challenge, this paper recommends the latter as the former limits the choice of techniques that can be used by scholars. Moreover, bibliometric data is often retrieved in a raw format, and thus, scholars will need to clean and prepare that data according to the format that is required for the chosen bibliometric analysis tech\u00ad niques. In this regard, the paper\u2019s recommendation of the latter will provide scholars with a wider rather than a limiting selection of bib\u00ad liometric analysis techniques for deployment. More importantly, the choice of bibliometric analysis techniques will depend on the aims of the study. For example, if the study intends to provide a review of the past, present, and future of a research field with a large bibliometric corpus, then a combination of co-citation analysis (past), bibliographic coupling (present), and co-word analysis (e.g., notable words in the implications and future research directions of full texts) (future) can be selected. Whereas, if the study is interested to uncover the themes in general and over specific periods, then the latter (i.e., co-word analysis) can be used in conjunction with author keywords to enrich the analysis of the former two (i.e., co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling). As mentioned, the performance analysis in bibliometric studies is akin to the profile of participants in empirical studies, and thus, by default, the components (e.g., total publications, total citations) of the performance analysis should be selected now, and analyzed and reported in a descriptive (i.e., what it is) yet analytical (i.e., what it means) way thereafter. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0990/09904fa8-0fb8-4381-9deb-e341f6130d5e.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFig. 4. Example of co-word (keyword co-occurrence) network visualization using Gephi. Note(s): Each node in a network represents an entity (e.g., article, author, country, institution, keyword, journal), and in the case of Fig. 4, a keyword, wherein: (1) the size of the node indicates the occurrence of the keyword (i.e., the number of times that the keyword occurs), (2) the link between the nodes represents the co-occurrence between keywords (i.e., keywords that co-occur or occur together), (3) the thickness of the link signals the occurrence of co-occurrences between keywords (i.e., the number of times that the keywords co-occur or occur together), (4) the bigger the node, the greater the occurrence of the keyword, and (5) the thicker the link between nodes, the greater the occurrence of the co-occurrences between keywords. Each color represents a thematic cluster, wherein the nodes and links in that cluster can be used to explain the theme\u2019s (cluster\u2019s) coverage of topics (nodes) and the relationships (links) between the topics (nodes) manifesting under that theme (cluster). \n# 5.3. Step 3: Collect the data for bibliometric analysis\nThe third step is to gather the data required for the selected biblio\u00ad metric analysis techniques in the second step. In this step, scholars will need to define search terms in a way that will yield search results that is large enough to warrant bibliometric analysis and yet focused enough to remain in the dedicated research field or the scope of study specified in the first step. In this regard, scholars have two options: first, scholars can consult the literature to identify a relevant combination of search terms, and second, scholars can brainstorm among themselves or with subjectmatter experts to curate suitable search terms. Following that, scholars will need to ascertain the bibliometric data that needs to be collected from the search results that are returned. In this regard, scholars should refer back to their chosen bibliometric analysis techniques for the study. For example, if scholars have selected co-word analysis in the second step, then they should focus on collecting the title, abstract, keywords, and full text of publications in the search results. However, in cases where the required data is not available, then the first and second steps should be revisited. More importantly, given that different databases have their own format of bibliometric data and that scholars may decide to use multiple databases (e.g., Scopus and Web of Science), then efforts\nshould be made to combine them into a single format. However, the paper\u2019s recommendation is to settle on one appropriate database to mitigate the need for that consolidation, as minimizing unnecessary action items can help to mitigate potential human errors. Moreover, data cleaning is essential because these databases are not exclusively designed for bibliometric analysis. Specifically, scholars should remove duplicates and erroneous entries. For example, the affiliation in the author field of entry may include more than one institution for a single author, which may be due to the database\u2019s assignment as a result of author profiling rather than that listed in the publication, and thus, in such cases, scholars should clean the entry so that only one valid affil\u00ad iation, which is the affiliation of the author at the time of publication, remains in the final dataset. Leaving such errors unattended may lead to an incorrect representation of the research field. \n# 5.4. Step 4: Run the bibliometric analysis and report the findings\nThe fourth and final step is to run the bibliometric analysis and  report the findings. In theory, the running of the bibliometric analysis  (and the generation of its accompanying summary) and the writing of  the bibliometric review are generally defined as separate steps (e.g., \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/fa9e/fa9e9b8f-9552-4e4e-a3ec-4fb57528bff6.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/4ef2/4ef21ff0-c4a1-41bb-b7c3-a52d09dab2a2.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFig. 5. The bibliometric analysis procedure. Note(s): TP = total publications. NCA = number of contributing authors. SA = sole-authored public authored publications. NAY = number of active years of publication. PAY = productivity per active year of publication. TC = total citations. AC = a CI = collaboration index. CC = collaboration coefficient. NCP = number of cited publications. PCP = proportion of cited publications. CCP = ci publication. h = h-index. g = g-index. i = i-index. Performance analysis metrics = see Table 2. Science mapping techniques = see Table 3. \nZupic & \u02c7Cater, 2015). However, in practice, these action items often go hand in hand. For example, the division of the network into clusters and the generation of visual network summaries directly inform the writing of the paper, wherein the need to bolster what is written in the paper can, in turn, lead to the addition of bibliometric summaries into the paper. Given this feedback loop, this paper positions the running of the bibliometric analysis, which generates bibliometric summaries, and the writing of the findings as a single step.  The style of writing is also important in this step. Most often, the style of writing is informed by the journal that the scholar is targeting and the field for which the study is being conducted. For example, one journal\nmay want scholars to focus on the theoretical aspects of the study (e.g., journals with an emphasis on theory and an unspecified page or word limitation) while another journal may want scholars to go straight into the summary of study findings (e.g., journals with specified and strict page or word limitation). In this regard, this paper recommends scholars to check with target journals to see if they have a history of publishing review papers, and if yes, then to retrieve those papers, and if possible, those that use bibliometrics, so that a similar style of writing can be crafted.  Finally, the paper encourages scholars to craft insightful discussions that engage directly with relevant trends and equivalent rationales\nTable 6\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The bibliometric analysis procedure and best practice (questions) guidelines.</div>\nNo. \nStep \nBest practice (questions) guidelines \nStep \n1 \nDefine the aims and scope of \nthe bibliometric study  \n\u2022 What are the aims and scope of the study?  \n\u2022 Is the scope of the study large enough to \nwarrant the use of bibliometric analysis? \nStep \n2 \nChoose the techniques for \nbibliometric analysis  \n\u2022 What bibliometric analysis techniques \nshould be chosen to meet the aims and \nscope of the study? \nStep \n3 \nCollect the data for \nbibliometric analysis  \n\u2022 Do the search terms exemplify the scope \nof the study?  \n\u2022 Is the coverage of the database adequate \nfor the study?  \n\u2022 Is the data free of errors such as \nduplicates and erroneous entries?  \n\u2022 Does the final dataset fulfil the \nrequirements of the bibliometric analysis \ntechniques chosen for the study? \nStep \n4 \nRun the bibliometric \nanalysis and report the \nfindings  \n\u2022 Can the bibliometric summary be easily \nunderstood by readers?  \n\u2022 Does the writing align with the \nbibliometric summary presented?  \n\u2022 Does the writing explain the peculiarities \nand implications of the bibliometric \nsummary?  \n\u2022 Does the writing align with the target \noutlet for publication?  \nrather than simply reporting a summary of the bibliometric corpus. That is, scholars should use bibliometric visualization in figures and tables to curate analytical over descriptive discussions. It would also be appro\u00ad priate to touch upon the concepts of content and context. In interpreting the findings from bibliometric analysis, it is important to understand the content of each thematic cluster and the meaning entailed in the topics of publications in that cluster. In order to grasp a good understanding of the content, it is also important to examine their contextual meaning in relation to the entities or events that characterize that content. For example, the co-word analysis presents scholars with different clusters of words. Scholars can rely on the words that manifest prominently in the cluster to understand its content (e.g., words that are more con\u00ad nected than others), yet they must also review how the words are con\u00ad nected to each other in order to decipher the context of each cluster (e. g., studies in which those words appear). \n# 6. Conclusion\nIn sum, this paper demonstrated that bibliometric analysis is a sci\u00ad entific method that can be useful for both established and emerging scholars who wish to pursue a retrospective of broad and rich areas in business research. The paper also established that the bibliometric methodology has gained immense popularity in recent times due to the omnipresence and usefulness of bibliometric software and databases that ease the acquisition and assessment of large volumes of scientific data in business research, including in relatively new but highly rich areas such as artificial intelligence and big data (Makarius, Mukherjee, Fox, & Fox, 2020; Mustak, Salminen, Ple, & Wirtz, 2021). More importantly, the paper, in its pursuit of a collegial and pragmatic endeavor, illustrated the anatomy of a meaningful bibliometric analysis for business research, wherein the bibliometric methodology is intro\u00ad duced, the various techniques are explained, the bibliometric analysis enhancements are unpacked, and the related procedures are provided. Through this endeavor, the paper makes clear that the techniques cho\u00ad sen and the decisions associated with each step to perform bibliometric analysis are critical because they influence the results obtained and the inferences that can be drawn from the analysis.  Nonetheless, it is important to understand that though bibliometric analysis is an effective method of summarizing and synthesizing litera\u00ad ture, it is not without limitations. First, the bibliometric data from sci\u00ad entific databases such as Scopus and Web of Science are not produced\nexclusively for bibliometric analysis and therefore can contain errors, wherein the presence of errors are bound to affect any analysis that is performed using such data. To mitigate errors, scholars must carefully clean the bibliometric data that they acquire, which includes removing duplicates and erroneous entries. Second, the nature of the bibliometric methodology is in itself a limitation. In particular, the qualitative as\u00ad sertions of bibliometrics can be quite subjective given that bibliometric analysis is quantitative in nature, wherein the relationship between quantitative and qualitative results is often unclear (Wallin, 2005). In this regard, scholars should take extra care when making qualitative assertions about bibliometric observations and supplement them with content analysis, where appropriate (Gaur & Kumar, 2018). Third, bibliometric studies can only offer a short-term forecast of the research field (Wallin, 2005), and thus, scholars should avoid making overambitious assertions about the research field and its impact in the long run.  Notwithstanding these limitations, the bibliometric methodology can empower scholars to overcome the fear of dealing with large bib\u00ad liometric datasets and to pursue ambitious retrospectives of business research. Indeed, the enhanced understanding of science through bib\u00ad liometric analysis can facilitate knowledge creation not only in business research but also in other fields. We take a short yet significant step in that direction. \n# References\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/942c/942c9d8c-40ea-4783-af42-57a57a3095ec.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/c9d1/c9d15ffa-13b8-4c9e-a616-3b5fa626f705.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/d95e/d95e1cdb-1077-4687-9fc1-e2aa2b9a18c1.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n",
