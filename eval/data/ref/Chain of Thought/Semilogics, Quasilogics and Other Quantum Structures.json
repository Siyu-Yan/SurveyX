The set \u2113of all propositions a, b, c, . . . about an arbitrary system is a partially ordered set with respect to the relation of logical inclusion: the proposition a \u2208\u2113\nis included in the proposition b \u2208\u2113: a \u2264b, if from a is true always follows b is true (it can be also said that the statement a is not weaker than the statement b ).

The identically false proposition, the zero 0, is the least element of \u2113, i.e. 0 \u2264a \u2200a \u2208\u2113, and the identically true proposition, the unity 1, is the greatest element of \u2113, i.e. 1 \u2265a \u2200a \u2208\u2113. The elements 0 and 1 are to be regarded as nullary operations, giving the strongest and the weakest proposition in \u2113. In each logic \u2113, the unary operation of negation a \ufffd\u2192\u00afa is introduced,\nwhich determines an involutive anti-automorphism of the partially ordered set \u2113, i.e.\nIt is easy to prove that from \u00af1 = 0, \u00af0 = 1, the de Morgan laws follow:\nThe elements a, b, if \u00afa \u2265b (\u00afa \u2264b), are called disjoint (conjoint) and the notation a \u22a5b (a\u22a4b) is used. The disjunction of disjoint elements is denoted by a sum, and the conjunction of conjoint elements is denoted by a product:\nNote that from a \u22a5b always follows a \u2227b = 0, and from a\u22a4b follows tha a \u2228b = 1, because the inequalities \u00afa \u2265b, \u00afa \u2264b give 0 = a \u2227\u00afa \u2265a \u2227b 1 = a \u2228\u00afa \u2264a \u2228b, correspondingly. In classical logics, described by the boolean algebras, the distributive law\ntaken as an axiom, turns every logic \u2113, determined by the axioms (1\u20134), in a distributive structure, where from the fact that a and b are non-simultaneous, i. e. a\u2227b = 0, follows that a and b are mutually exclusive, i. e. a \u22a5b, and vice\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\nversa. However, the empirical data of quantum physics show the existence of non-simultaneous propositions a, b, that are not mutually exclusive in the sense that \u00afa \u2265b. For example, the statements \u201cthe impulse of a particle has the value p \u2208\u2206p\u201d and \u201cthe value of the coordinate is q \u2208\u2206q\u201d are, according to the uncertainty law, non-simultaneous, though they don\u2019t exclude each other: if the result of some experiment would be that one of the statements is true, it doesn\u2019t mean that the other is false at all. Instead of the completely non-obvious condition (5), in the logics of physical systems a much weaker and intuitively clear condition holds:\n(a \u2228b) \u2227c = a \u2228(b \u2227c),\n(a \u2228b) \u2227c = a \u2228(b \u2227c), \u2200a \u2264\u00afb \u2264c\nIts meaning will be revealed in the following theorem.\nTheorem 1 Each segment [a, c] in a logic \u2113, satisfying the condition (6), is a logic, where the zero equals a, the unity equals c and the operation of complementation is given by\nProof First, with respect to (6), the complementation is well defined and the equalities b \u2228(a \u2228\u00afb \u2227c) = c and b \u2227(a \u2228\u00afb \u2227c) = a follow straight from the definitions of supremum and infimum \u2228and \u2227. As a \u2228\u00afb \u2227c is a monotone function of b, the inequality a \u2264b1 \u2264b2 \u2264c leads to the inequality a \u2228\u00afb1 \u2227c \u2265a \u2228\u00afb2 \u2227c. Now it stays to prove the involutivity\na \u2228(a \u2228\u00afb \u2227c) \u2227c = a \u2228\u00afa \u2227b \u2228\u00afc \u2227c = b\nThe proof is complete. Thus the system of logical axioms (1\u20136) is natural, but not independent, as follows from the de Morgan laws (3).\n# 1.2 Semilogics and quasilogics\nA semilogic is a mathematical model M with the zero 0 \u2208M, a partial operation of the logical multiplication (a, b) \ufffd\u2192ab \u2208M and an operation\n(6)\nof the logical addition {ai} \ufffd\u2192\ufffd i ai \u2208M, defined for some families {ai} o pairwise orthogonal elements ai \u2208M, ai1ai2 = 0, i1 \u0338= i2; described by th following axioms:\nThe binary relation a\u00af\u2193b \u21d4ab \u2208M, which can be seen as the domain of the commutative multiplication and is called the relation of logical commutation, has the following properties:\nThe summable families {ai}, for which the symmetric and associative sums \ufffd i ai are defined, consist of either mutually different, or zero elements ai \u2208M and can be identified with the subsets A \u2286M, 0 /\u2208A, where \ufffd i ai = \ufffd a\u2208A a. The family A of such subsets contains the empty set \u2205\u2282M, here, according to the definition, \ufffd a\u2208\u2205a = 0; all the nonzero one-point subsets {a} \u2282M, a \u0338= 0, here \ufffd a\u2208{a} a = a; while the union of arbitrary summable subsets Ai \u2208A, determining summable elements ai = \ufffd a\u2208Ai a, {ai} = A \u2208A, is also summable, i. e. \u222aAi \u2208A. Besides, it is assumed that if a\u00af\u2193b, then decompositions a = \ufffd a\u2032\u2208A a\u2032 and b = \ufffd b\u2032\u2208B b\u2032, included in some decomposition c = \ufffd c\u2032\u2208C c\u2032 \u2208M, A \u222aB \u2286C exist, the intersection of which gives the decomposition ab = \ufffd d\u2208A\u2229B d. In particular, this means that the logical multiplication and addition define one and the same relation of logical ordering: ab = a iff for any decomposition a = \ufffd a\u2032\u2208A a\u2032, A \u2208A, there is a decomposition b = \ufffd b\u2032\u2208B b\u2032, B \u2208A, such that A \u2286B, denoted by a \u2264b. By the axioms, the binary relation \u2264is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric, 0 is the least element and the product ab is equal to the greatest lower bound a\u2227b = inf{a, b} and the sum \ufffd a\u2208A a is equal to the least upper bound \ufffd a\u2208A a = supa\u2208A a with respect to this ordering. It is usual to assume that a \u2227b \u2208M for any a, b \u2208M, and only the finite sums \ufffd i ai, determined by finite subsets A \u2282M are studied, but it is possible to consider infinite sums too, defining those as least upper bounds \ufffd i ai = \ufffd i ai.\nAn element a \u2208M is called an atom, if from b < a follows b = 0, i. e. if this element cannot be decomposed into a sum of two nonzero elements. If for any b \u0338= 0 there is an atom a \u2264b, the semilogic is atomic. Each semilogic of finite rank is atomic, as any element a \u2208M can be represented in a form of a sum \ufffd i ai = a of atoms ai \u2208M. A semilogic, such that for any family {ai}i\u2208I of cardinality |I| \u2264\u03c4 the greatest lower bound \ufffd i\u2208I ai \u2208M is defined, is called \u03c4-complete, or a \u03c4-semilogic if \u03c4 is not less than the maximum cardinality |A| of summable families A \u2208M. A quasilogic1 is a partially ordered set N with a partial operation of subtraction:\nhaving the property\nIf the greatest element 1 \u2265a, \u2200a \u2208N exists in N , then we can define the complementation \u00afa = 1 \u2212a, which obviously has the property (2); however, this is not necessary in general and we will suppose just that N is upwards directed in the sense of existence of a majorating element c \u2208N : c \u2265a, b for each pair a, b \u2208N . This yields the existence and uniqueness of the least element 0 = a \u2212a and an involutive anti-automorphism a \ufffd\u2192c \u2212a of any segment [0, c] \u2282N onto itself, so that if the existence of supremum and infimum a \u2228b and a \u2227b is assumed, the de Morgan formulas hold:\nFor each pair a, b \u2208N , such that there is an element c \u2265a, b : c \u2212a \u2265b (or equivalently, c \u2212b \u2265a, denoted by a\u2191b) this supposition allows us to define a partial operation of addition a + b by putting\nFirst, (a + b) \u2212b = a and (a + b) \u2212a = b hold by the axioms (8) and (9) and the equality (c \u2212a) \u2212b = (c \u2212b) \u2212a follows. Moreover, the definition of the\nFirst, (a + b) \u2212b = a and (a + b) \u2212a = b hold by the axioms (8) and (9) and the equality (c \u2212a) \u2212b = (c \u2212b) \u2212a follows. Moreover, the definition of the 1The quasilogics are also called D-posets, see for example [3].\n(7)\n(8) (9)\n(10)\n(11)\nsum a + b doesn\u2019t depend on c, because for any c1 and c2 there is an upp bound c \u2265c1, c2, such that by the axioms (8) and (9)\nIt is easy to prove that such binary partial operation of addition is commutative: if a\u2191b then b\u2191a and a + b = b + a, associative: if a\u2191(b + c) then (a + b)\u2191c and\nzero 0 is the neutral element 0 + a = a + 0 = a and\nzero 0 is the neutral element 0 + a = a + 0 = a and a + b = a \u2228b + a \u2227b if a \u2228b, a \u2227b \u2208N\nWe will say that a, b \u2208N quasicommute, a \u2193b, if there is a c \u2265a, b such that c \u2212a \u2264b (or c \u2212b \u2264a). The relation a \u2193b means the summability p\u2191q of the elements p = c \u2212a and q = c \u2212b, determining the decompositions a = (ab)c +q and b = (ab)c +p where (ab)c denotes the quasiproduct of a and b with respect to c, defined as\nThe elements a, b \u2208N are disjoint a \u22a5b, if they are summable: a\u2191b and non-simultaneous: a \u2227b = 0; and (logically) commuting a\u00af\u2193b, if for some c \u2265a, b the elements p = c \u2212a and q = c \u2212b are disjoint; in agreement with (12) we have a + b = a \u2228b if a \u22a5b and ab = a \u2227b if a\u00af\u2193b. A quasilogic, where only the disjoint elements are summable is a semilogic with respect to the defined partial operations of logical sum a + b = a \u2228b and product ab = a \u2227b and is called an ortho-logic or simply a logic. Hence a logic \u2113is a upwards directed semilogic M with an operation of subtraction b \u2212a \u2208\u2113if ab = a, behaving by the axioms (8) and (9), where the summable families are at most all finite families {ai} of mutually disjoint elements ai1 \u22a5ai2, i1 \u0338= i2:\nA quasilogic (logic) N is \u03c4-complete, if each downwards directed family {ai}i\u2208I of cardinality \u03c4 has the greatest lower bound \ufffdai, and a \u03c4-quasilogic if for each family {ai}i\u2208I, |I| \u2264\u03c4 of mutually summable elements ai \u2208N there is an element a \u2208N : ai \u2264a, \u2200i \u2208I.\n(12)\n# 1.3 Homomorphisms and closures\nFunctional relations between different systems or their parts are described by logical homomorphisms of the corresponding logics, defined as additive mappings h : M \u2192N , \ufffd \ufffd\ngiving a representation of the logic (semilogic) M in a logic (quasilogic) N . Each such mapping is monotone:\nh(b \u2212a) = h(b) \u2212h(a)\nif N is a logic; in this case h(ab) = h(a)h(b). A homomorphism h is \u03c4-additive (completely additive), if (13) is fulfilled not only for all finite summable families, but also for all infinite summable families {ai} \u2282M of cardinality |I| \u2264\u03c4 (of arbitrary cardinality); and a \u03c4-homomorphism (normal homomorphism), if \ufffd i\u2208I h(ai) = 0 for \ufffd i\u2208I ai = 0 for each zero directed family {ai} of cardinality |I| \u2264\u03c4 (any cardinality). Each \u03c4-homomorphism of a \u03c4-logic M into a \u03c4-logic N is \u03c4-additive. Note that in the definition of the homomorphisms we, in general, do not need preservation of unity, if it occurs in M and N ; however, if h is an epimorphism, i. e. if h(M) = N , then from 1 \u2208M follows that h(1) = 1 \u2208 N . An approximate unity in a semilogic (quasilogic) M is a family I \u2286M of elements i \u2208I, satisfying the following conditions:\n# 1. for any a \u2208M there is an element i \u2208I, i \u2265a, 2. for each pair i1, i2 there is an i \u2265i1, i2.\nA homomorphism h : M \u2192N is called approximate, if the least logic (quasilogic) \u2113\u2286N , containing the image h(M), is an approximate unity in N ; and \u03c4-approximate if the least \u03c4-logic (\u03c4-quasilogic) \u2113\u2286N , h(M) \u2286\u2113is\n(13)\nan approximate unity. If M is a \u03c4-logic and h is a \u03c4-homomorphism, then h(M) is a \u03c4-quasilogic and the notions of approximity and \u03c4-approximity are identical; here h(1) = 1 \u2208N , if 1 \u2208M. Any homomorphism h : M \u2192N , preserving the approximate unity I \u2286M: h(I) = J , where J \u2282N is a given approximate unity, is approximate. A subset I \u2286M is called an upper family of a semilogic (quasilogic) M, if an element i \u2265a exists in I for each element a \u2208M and for any i1, i2 \u2208I, i1, i2 \u2265a, there is i \u2265a in I, such that i1, i2 \u2265i. The lower family K \u2286M is defined analogically, such family is called opposite to I, if i\u2212k \u2208I whenever i \u2208I, k \u2208K, i \u2265k. These families I and K are called approximate from above and from below, respectively, if\n# \ufffd {i \u2208I : i \u2265a} = a, \ufffd {k \u2208K : k \u2264a} = a\nfor a \u2208M; and \u03c4-approximate, if the above conditions are fulfilled for some subsets {i} \u2265a, {k} \u2264a of I and K with cardinality \u2264\u03c4. A closure in a semilogic (logic) is a projection k : M \u2192M, k \u25e6k = k, satisfying the conditions\nk(0) = 0, k(a) \u2265a, k(a \u2228b) = k(a) \u2228k(b).\nAn element a \u2208M is closed, if it equals its closure: a = k(a), and open, if k \u2212a is closed whenever k \u2265a is closed. The set K = k(M) of all closed elements is a lower family, containing the supremum k1 \u2228k2 of any pair k1, k2 \u2208K and the infimum \ufffdki of any family {ki} \u2282K if it is defined in M; and is \u03c4-approximate from below, if some upper \u03c4-approximate family of open elements i \u2208M is contained in M. The set I of all open elements i \u2208M, defining a projection\nfulfils the condition i1 \u2227i2 \u2208I for each pair i1, i2 \u2208I and is an upper family; if it forms an approximate unity in M, then it is called dual to K. If M contains an unity 1 \u2208M, then 1 \u2208I, because the family dual to K is a set of the complements i = 1 \u2212k, k \u2208K.\n# 1.4 Logical states\nA real positive function m on a semilogic (quasilogic) M is called a distrib tion, if it satisfies the additivity condition\nAny distribution is monotone: a \u2264b \u21d2m(a) \u2264m(b), preserves zero: m(0) = 0 and can be considered as a homomorphism into the quasilogic R+ of positive numbers with the natural ordering and with the operations of subtraction and addition. The distributions defined on a \u03c4-semilogic (\u03c4-quasilogic) are called \u03c4-additive (\u03c4-distributions), if they are \u03c4-additive homomorphisms (\u03c4homomorphisms); and measures (\u03c4-additive measures, \u03c4-measures), if M is a logic (\u03c4-logic) \u2113. A distribution (measure) m : M \u2192R+ is bounded, if it has a finite mass \u2225m\u2225= sup \ufffdm(ai) (the supremum is taken over all possible disjoint families {ai} \u2282M); and completely additive (normal) if it is \u03c4-additive (a \u03c4-distribution) for any \u03c4. Each distribution defined on a logic (quasilogic) with unity 1 \u2208M is finite: \u2225m\u2225= m(1) < \u221e, and completely additive, if it is \u03c4-additive for some \u03c4 = dim(M), where dim(M) is the maximal number of pairwise summable elements in M. The set of all elements a \u2208M, such that m(a) = 0, forms an ideal in M, called the zero ideal of the distribution (measure) m. In general, an ideal of a semilogic M is a nonempty proper subset \u2206\u2282M, having the properties:  \u2227 \u2208 \u2208M \u2208\n# b) \ufffdai \u2208\u2206for all summable ai \u2208\u2206.\nThe ideal \u2206is called a \u03c4-ideal (a complete ideal), if \ufffdai \u2208\u2206for all summable families {ai}i\u2208I of cardinality |I| \u2264\u03c4 (any cardinality). The zero ideal of a \u03c4-additive (completely additive) distribution is a \u03c4-ideal (a complete ideal). Other examples of \u03c4-ideals in semilogics of range \u03c4 (\u03c4-complete logics) are the regular ideals, determined by some (not maximal) element b \u2208M as the subset \u2206= {a \u2208M : a \u22a5b}. The ideal \u2206is called a maximal ideal, if it is not a proper subset of any other ideal. Each maximal regular ideal is determined by some atom q \u2208M. A distribution p : M \u2192[0, 1] of a mass \u2225p\u2225= 1 is a probability distribution (measure). A probability distribution (measure) on a logic (quasilogic) is a state if p(c) = 1 for some c \u2208M. The set \u2207of all such c, the support of p, doesn\u2019t contain zero 0 /\u2208\u2207and has the following properties:\n(14)\nIn the case when M is a semilogic, the last condition has the form a, b \u2208\u2207, a\u00af\u2193b \u21d2ab \u2208\u2207,\nwhere \u00af\u2193is the relation of logical commutation and ab = a \u2227b is the logical multiplication with the domain \u00af\u2193. Such set \u2207in a logic \u2113is called a filter, and a \u03c4-filter (complete filter if, together with the condition b), the condition \ufffd i\u2208I ai \u2208\u2207is satisfied for any pairwise commuting family {ai}i\u2208I of cardinality |I| \u2264\u03c4 (any cardinality). The unit filters - the supports of a \u03c4-state p, as well as the regular filters in a \u03c4-logic \u2113, defined as subsets \u2207= {a \u2208\u2113: a \u2265b} for some b \u2208\u2113, are \u03c4-filters. Let M be a semilogic (logic) with an approximate upper family I and an approximate lower family K. A distribution (measure, state) is regular if it is continuous with respect to the topology on M, generated by the intervals [k, i] = {a : k \u2264a \u2264i} for all i \u2208I, k \u2208K. A necessary and sufficient condition for regularity of a distribution is given by the following approximate property:\nsup{m(k) : k \u2264a, k \u2208K} = m(a) = inf{m(i) : i \u2265a, i \u2208I},\nin the case that K is opposite to I, the second part of the above is a consequence of the first part. A distribution m is called \u03c4-regular, if m(a\u03bb) \u2192m(a) for any \u03c4-net {a\u03bb} converging to a \u2208M, in particular, a distribution is \u03b4-regular if m(an) \u2192m(a) for any an \u2192a. Each \u03c4-distribution on a \u03c4complete semilogic M is \u03c4-regular, and completely regular, if I and K are \u03c4-approximate families in M. In particular, any normal distribution is regular, the converse holds for I = M = K.\n# 2 Classical systems\n# 2.1 Boolean rings\nA quasilogic N with a trivial relation of quasicommutation a \u2193b, \u2200a, b \u2208N , is called a quasiring, and a (boolean) ring, if each pair a, b \u2208N logically\ncommute, i. e. a\u00af\u2193b. In other words, a quasiring (ring) is a partially ordered set N with subtraction: a \u2264b \u21d2b \u2212a \u2208N , such that for any pair a, b an element c \u2265a, b exists, such that the elements c \u2212a and c \u2212b are summable (disjoint): c\u2212a \u2265b and c\u2212b \u2265a (c\u2212a \u22a5c\u2212b). Classical systems, ruled by the boolean logic, are usually described by distributive logics, i.e. boolean rings A (algebras) of propositions, taking the conjunction a \u2227b = ab, the difference a \\ b = a \u2212ab and the disjunction a \u2228b = ab + a \\ b + b \\ a as the principal operations, defined everywhere by triviality of the relation \u00af\u2193. A boolean ring (a boolean algebra is a ring with unity 1 \u2208A, 1 \u2227a = a, \u2200a \u2208A) is a \u03c4-complete ring (a \u03c4-ring, \u03c4-algebra) if it is a \u03c4-complete logic (a \u03c4-logic) with respect to the multiplication ab = a\u2227b, addition a+b = a\u2228b if a \u2227b = 0 and subtraction a \u2212b = a \\ b for a \u2227b = b. In a \u03c4-complete ring, the \u03c4-infinite conjunction \ufffd i\u2208I ai \u2208A, for arbitrary ai \u2208A, if |I| \u2264\u03c4, and, consequently, the \u03c4-infinite disjunction \ufffd i\u2208I ai \u2208A, if ai \u2264a \u2208A, \u2200i \u2208I, are defined (\ufffd i\u2208I ai \u2208A for arbitrary ai \u2208A if |I| \u2264\u03c4 for the \u03c4-rings). By method of transfinite induction with respect to the cardinal number \u03c4, it can be proved that the existence of the least upper bound \ufffd i\u2208I ai = \ufffd i\u2208I ai for an arbitrary majorated \u03c4-family {ai}i\u2208I \u2282A, |I| = \u03c4, of mutually disjoint elements ai \u2264a, \u2200i \u2208I, is a sufficient condition for \u03c4-completeness of the ring A; moreover, A is a \u03c4-ring if the majoration condition is not substantial. The subalgebras and factor-algebras of \u03c4-rings are the \u03c4-closed and the \u03c4-congruent subsets (A) \u2286A and {A} \u2aafA with the natural boolean operations. A \u03c4-closed subset of A is a subset (A) containing the zero of the ring A, 0 \u2208A, which is closed under the difference a, b \u2208(A) \u21d2a \\ b \u2208(A) and the \u03c4-infinite conjunction \ufffd t\u2208T at \u2208(A), if at \u2208A, \u2200t \u2208T, |T| \u2264\u03c4. A \u03c4-congruent factor-set in A is a set of equivalence classes {A} \u2282A of an equivalence given by some ideal \u2206\u2282A: a \u223cb iff a \\ b \u2208\u2206and b \\ a \u2208\u2206. Usually, as \u03c4-complete rings, the rings A of subsets A \u2286X of some set X with natural boolean operations, i.e. some \u03c4-closed subalgebras A \u2286A(X) of the field A(X) of all subsets of X, not necessarily containing the unity X \u2208A(X), are considered. The points x \u2208X of this set, contained at least in one A \u2208A, are interpreted as the elementary propositions, defining complete descriptions of the states of some classical system, resulting from attaching the true value to some of these points x, so that A \u2208A is true if x \u2208A, and false if x /\u2208A. A ring A is separating, if for each x1 \u0338= x2, an A \u2208A exists, such that x1 \u2208A and x2 /\u2208A, and perfect, if each non-trivial maximal ideal \u2206\u2282A\nis generated by some point x \u2208X, i.e. \u2206= {A \u2208A : x /\u2208A}. A \u03c4-complete ring is \u03c4-perfect, if the last condition is fulfilled at least for all maximal \u03c4-ideals in A. Each \u03c4-complete ring A \u2286A(X) is isomorphic with some separating \u03c4-perfect ring B \u2286A(X), which is a boolean \u03c4-algebra with unity E \u2208B, if there is a unity in A (unity means a maximal subset, not necessarily identical with X). The homomorphisms of boolean rings A \u2286A(X), B \u2286A(E), are the logical (algebraical) homomorphisms h : B \u2192A of them as logics (algebras), induced by the partial mappings f : (X) \u2192E, h = f \u2217, where f \u2217(B) = {x : f(x) \u2208B} is the preimage of the subset B \u2286E. Such mapping f satisfy the condition f \u2217(B) \u2208A for each B \u2208B and are called (A, B)-measurable. A sufficient condition for an algebraical \u03c4-homomorphism h : B \u2192A to be induced by some measurable mapping f : (X) \u2192E is the \u03c4-perfectness of the ring B. If also A is a \u03c4-perfect ring, then this condition is necessary, too. Each \u03c4-subalgebra of a \u03c4-ring A \u2286A(X) is obviously a ring of subsets of X, but not every factor-algebra A can be represented as a subalgebra A1 \u2286A(X1). For a factor-algebra of a \u03c4-ring A \u2286A(X) by the \u03c4-ideal \u2206, a sufficient, and, in the case that this ring is \u03c4-perfect, also a necessary condition to be a \u03c4-field is that the ideal is generated by some subset X1 \u2282X, i.e. \u2206= {A \u2208A : A \u2229X1 = 0}. As for the \u03c3-rings, the following theorem shows to be useful (see [4]):\nTheorem 2 Let B be a standard field of borel subsets B \u2208B of a polish space E. Then each \u03c3-homomorphism h : B \u2192A/\u2206into a factor algebra of some \u03c3-ring A \u2286A(X) by a \u03c3-ideal \u2206\u2282A is induced by a point mapping f : X \u2192E in the sense that h = jf \u2217, where j : A \u2192\u27e8A\u27e9is the factorisation homomorphism A \u2192A/\u2206.\n# 2.2 Semirings and topologies\nA boolean semiring B is a distributive semilogic\na \u2227( \ufffd i\u2208I bi) = \ufffd i\u2208I (a \u2227bi), a \u2208B, b = \ufffd i\u2208I bi \u2208B\nwith respect to the everywhere defined operation of conjunction a \u2227b = ab and the operation of disjunction \ufffd i\u2208I bi defined for summable families {bi} of pairwise non-simultaneous elements bi1 \u2227bi2 = 0, i1 \u0338= i2 as a logical sum:\n\ufffdbi = \ufffdbi. Moreover, a semiring of rank \u03c4 is a boolean semiring, which is a semilogic of rank \u03c4, and a \u03c4-semiring is a semiring of rank \u03c4, such that the greatest lower bounds \ufffd i\u2208I bi are defined for families of cardinality |I| \u2264\u03c4. Each semiring (\u03c4-semiring), for which the disjunction is defined for each disjoint pair a, b \u2208B (for each disjoint family {bi} of cardinality |I| \u2264\u03c4), is a ring (a \u03c4-ring), because the relation a \u2264c in this case means the existence of b = c \u2212a, which is, by distributivity of B, uniquely defined by the conditions a \u2227b = 0, a \u2228b = c. A semiring of subsets is any boolean semiring B \u2286A(X) of some set X with the empty set \u2205\u2208B as zero, the intersection A \u2229B = AB \u2208B for each A, B \u2208B and union \ufffdBi = \ufffdBi \u2208B for summable families {Bi} of pairwise disjoint subsets Bi1 \u2229Bi2 = \u2205, i1 \u0338= i2. Each boolean semiring of subsets B \u2286A(X) generates a boolean ring (a \u03c4-ring) of subsets A \u2286A(X), consisting of all finite (\u03c4-infinite) sums A = \ufffdBi, Bi \u2208B, and \u03c4-complete if B is a \u03c4-complete semiring. A system of open subsets in a semiring B \u2286A(X) is a family I \u2286B of subsets I \u2286X, satisfying the conditions:\n# 1) for each B \u2208B there is a majorating subset I \u2208I, B \u2286I,\nThe mapping B \ufffd\u2192I(B) maps each subset B \u2208B to the greatest open subset I(B) \u2208I contained in it, the set I(B) is called the interior of B. The mapping has the following properties: I(B1 \u2229B2) = I(B1) \u2229I(B2), I(\u222aBi) \u2287\u222aI(Bi), while I(B) = B iff B \u2208I (B is open). The family I contains all unions \u222aIi of open subsets Ii \u2208I defined in B, including the empty set \u2205\u2208I, it is an approximate unity if B is a ring and it is called approximate from above, if, instead of 1), a stronger condition is satisfied: \ufffd I\u2287B I = B for every B \u2208B. A system of closed subsets in a semiring B \u2286A(X) is a family K \u2286B of subsets K \u2286X, fulfilling the conditions:\n1) \u2205\u2208K,\n# 3) K(B) = \ufffd K\u2287B K \u2208K for each B \u2208B.\nThe mapping k : B \ufffd\u2192k(B) is the closure mapping, assigning to every B \u2208B the least closed subset K \u2208K, containing B. The family K contains all intersections \u2229Ki of closed subsets Ki \u2208K defined in B, it is an approximate unity if B is a ring and it is called approximate from below if in place of 1) we have \ufffd K\u2286B K = B for each B \u2208B. A topology in a boolean ring B is a pair T = (I, K) of families I, K \u2286B of open and closed subsets I, K \u2286X, which is in duality: I \u2229\u00afK \u2208I for each I \u2208I and a closed K \u2286I; K \u2229\u00afI \u2208K for each K \u2208K and an open I \u2286K. A topology (I, K) is Hausdorff, if the families I, K are approximate. If the ring B contains a unity E \u2286X, then the family I of open subsets consists of all complements (with respect to E) I = E \u2229\u00afK = E \\ K of the closed subsets K \u2208K, and, conversely, the family K consists of the complements K = E \u2229\u00afI = E \\ I, I \u2208I. The intersection A = I \u2229K \u2286B is a boolean ring of clopen subsets in B, it contains zero \u2205\u2208A and unity E \u2208A, if the latter is defined in B. The notion of topology in a boolean ring B is a generalization of the notion of topological space, which is defined by a dual system T = (I, K) of open I \u2208I and closed K \u2208K subsets in the field B = A(X) of all subsets of the set X; here \u222aIi \u2208I, \u2229Ki \u2208K for arbitrary families {Ii} \u2286I, {Ki} \u2286K, X \u2208I \u2229K and a set I (K) is open (closed) iff the complement \u00afI is closed ( \u00afK is open):\nThe smallest \u03c4-field A \u2282A(X), containing all open and closed subsets of the topological space (X, T ), is called a \u03c4-borel field (a borel field, if \u03c4 = \u03c3). Every topology (I, K), given on a ring B \u2286A(X), generates a topological space (X, T ), all unions \u222aIi and also the whole set X being the open subsets, here the space (X, T ) is Hausdorff if the family I is attainable and sup I = X. The \u03c4-borel field A contains B if the latter is a \u03c4-field generated by the family (I, K), e.g. if I = B = K. More generally, let f : (X) \u2192X\u2032 be a partial mapping of the topological space (X, T ) into a space X\u2032 with a \u03c4-ring B \u2286A(X\u2032), generated by a topology (I, K), and let the preimage f \u2217(I) of each open subset I \u2208I be open in (X, T ). Then f is a continuous mapping with respect to the generated topology T \u2032 on X\u2032, and h = f \u2217is a \u03c4-homomorphism of the \u03c4-ring B into the \u03c4-borel field A \u2286A(X).\n# 2.3 Observations and representations\nThe observed events are usually described by means of elements of some semiring (ring) B. To determine an observation in a system, described by a logic \u2113, means to give a logical corresponding of the observed events b \u2208B by some propositions a = h(b) \u2208\u2113. Each homomorphism h : B \u2192\u2113, describing such representation, is called an observable (a quasiobservable) on a logic (quasilogic) \u2113over the semiring (ring) B. The observables on \u03c4-logics ( \u03c4quasilogics) are described by the \u03c4-homomorphisms of \u03c4-semirings (\u03c4-rings) B, usually, the borel fields - the \u03c3-rings B \u2286A(E) of subsets of some set E are studied. The image h(B) of the semiring B generates a boolean ring (a \u03c4-ring) A \u2286\u2113of some propositions in the logic (\u03c4-logic) \u2113, that commute a1 \u2193a2 if a1, a2 \u2208A. For this reason, it is always possible to describe one fixed observable on the logic \u2113by the representation of the boolean semiring B in some ring A, usually the boolean algebra A \u2286A(X) of subsets of some set X is considered. This choice is based on the Stone theorem on the existence of a representation of any boolean algebra in some field of subsets, the field of clopen subsets of some compact, completely disconnected topological space (X, T ). We will show the Stone\u2019s construction, generalizing it to the case of the semirings B of finite rank, and also of the boolean ring, not necessarily containing unity. Let us denote X0 the set of the maximal filters of the semiring B, note that the filter x = \u2207, defined, in the boolean semiring, by the conditions: 1) 0 /\u2208\u2207, 2) a \u2208\u2207, b \u2265a \u21d2b \u2208\u2207, 3) a, b \u2208\u2207\u21d2a \u2227b \u2208\u2207 is maximal iff for any a /\u2208\u2207there is a b \u2208\u2207, such that a \u2227b = 0. Assigning the set h0(b) = {x : b \u2208x} to each b \u2208B, we get by this definition: h0(0) = \u2205, b \u2265a \u21d2h0(b) \u2287h0(a), h0(a \u2227b) = h0(a) \u2229h0(b). Moreover, for any finite family {ak}, from the condition ak /\u2208x for each k follows the existence of b = \u2227bk, bk \u2208x, bk \u2227ak = 0, for which b \u2227(\u2228ak) = 0, by distributivity, i.e. \u2228ak /\u2208x, or x /\u2208h0(\u2228ak), if\nMoreover, for any finite family {ak}, from the condition ak /\u2208x for each k follows the existence of\nfor which b \u2227(\u2228ak) = 0, by distributivity, i.e. \u2228ak /\u2208x, or x /\u2208h0(\u2228ak), if x /\u2208h0(ak) for each k.\nBecause, on the other hand, from ak \u2264\u2228ak follows that h0(ak) \u2286h0(\u2228ak), we have h0(\u2228ak) = \u222ah0(ak) for any finite family {ak}. Hence the mapping h0 : B \u2192A(X0) is a homomorphism of the semiring B into the field of subsets of maximal filters x \u2208X0, preserving the disjointness:\n# Because, on the other hand, from ak \u2264\u2228ak follows that h0(ak) \u2286h0(\u2228ak), we have h0(\u2228ak) = \u222ah0(ak) for any finite family {ak}. Hence the mapping h0 : B \u2192A(X0) is a homomorphism of the semiring B into the field of subsets of maximal filters x \u2208X0, preserving the disjointness:\na \u2227b = 0 \u21d2h0(a) \u2229h0(b) = \u2205\nand, consequently, the operation of subtraction\nif B is a ring. Such representation is faithful, because for each a \u0338= 0, there is at least one maximal filter x: a \u2208x (the filter \u2207= {b : b \u2265a} can be extended to a maximal filter, by the axiom of choice). The semiring (ring) B0 = h0(B) has a finite rank and is perfect, because each maximal filter is \u2207\u2282B0 is a filter {h0(b) : b \u2208x}, determined by some element x \u2208X0,\nand separating: for each x1 \u0338= x2 there is a b \u2208x1, b /\u2208x2, i.e. x1 = h0(b), x2 /\u2208h0(b). Moreover, every B \u2208B0 is an open compact subset of the locally compact completely disconnected space (X0, T0) with the base B0, and each open compact subset A \u2286X0 in the topology T0 is a finite sum A = \ufffdn k=1 Bk of disjoint Bk \u2208B0. First, each B \u2208B0 is open, because according to the definition of the topology T0, the open subsets A of X0 are all the unions A = \u222aBi, Bi \u2208B0. On the other hand, each B \u2208B0 is closed, as \u00afB is open:\n\u00afB = \u00afB \u2229X0 = \u222a( \u00afB \u2229Bi) = \u222aBik,\nwhere Bi cover X0 = \u222aBi and Bik \u2208B0 is a finite decomposition of \u00afB \u2229Bi = \u222ani k=1Bik (the set of finite unions \u222aBk, Bk \u2208B0 is a boolean ring, invariant under the operation A \\ B = \u00afB \u2229A). Consequently, each B \u2208B is clopen and compact, because it is a space of Stone\u2019s representation of the boolean algebra A = {a \u2208B, a \u2264b}, h0(b) = B. As the sets B \u2208B0 cover X0 and separate its points, the space (X0, T0) is locally compact and completely disconnected, and every open compact set A \u2282X0 of this topological space has the form A = \ufffdn k=1 Bk (the covering A = \u222aBi has a finite subcovering, that can be decomposed into a sum of disjoint Bk \u2208B0 by the finiteness\nof the rank of the semiring B). Note that if B is a boolean ring, then the representing semiring B0 = h0(B) is identical with the generated ring A0 of all open compact subsets of the space (X0, T ). As the space X0 = h0(1) is compact if 1 \u2208B, the ring A0 = h0(A) for any boolean algebra A is a boolean algebra of clopen subsets with the complementation:\nUnfortunately, the isomorphism h0 : B \u2192B0 is only finite-additive and cannot be used for the construction of \u03c4-representations in the category of semirings of the infinite rank \u03c4 . The maximal \u03c4-subrepresentation h\u03c4 : B \u2192h0 (b) \u2229X\u03c4 of the universal representation h0 , which represents the elements b \u2208B by the subsets B \u2286X\u03c4 of maximal \u03c4-filters x \u2208X\u03c4 , is not in general faithful. It is faithful only if for each b \u0338= 0 there exists a maximal \u03c4-filter \u2207containing b , what cannot be true already for \u03c4 = \u03c3 . In general case the universal \u03c4-representation can be obtained as a factorrepresentation j\u03c4 \u25e6h0 : B \u2192A\u03c4/\u2206\u03c4 in the \u03c4-completion A\u03c4 = A0 \u2228\u2206\u03c4 of the ring A0 of the space X0 , factorised with respect to the \u03c4-ideal of all compact subsets A \u2208A\u03c4/\u2206\u03c4.of the \u03c4-category. If the ideal \u2206\u03c4 is regular, the factorrepresentation is equivalent to the \u03c4-subrepresentation h\u03c4 : B \u2192A (X\u03c4) . Although in general case the\u03c4-ideal \u2206\u03c4 is smaller than the regular ideal {A \u2208A\u03c4 : A \u2229X\u03c4 = \u2205} , the universal \u03c4-homomorphism j\u03c4 \u25e6h0 could be faithful even in this case as it follows from the next theorem for \u03c4 = \u03c3 . Theorem 3 Each \u03c3-semiring B is \u03c3-isomorphic with some semiring B\u03c3 \u2286 A\u03c3/\u2206\u03c3 of a factor algebra of the \u03c3-completion A\u03c3 = A0 \u2228\u2206\u03c3 of the ring all open compact subsets of a locally compact space X0 of maximal filters x \u2282B by the \u03c3-ideal \u2206\u03c3 of the compact subsets A \u2208A of the first category. The proof of this theorem is a modification of the proof, given in [4] for the case of \u03c3-algebras, to the case of the semirings (rings), which is analogical to the modification of the Stone theorem, given above.\nThe proof of this theorem is a modification of the proof, given in [4] for the case of \u03c3-algebras, to the case of the semirings (rings), which is analogical to the modification of the Stone theorem, given above.\n# 2.4 Regular distributions\nIf h : B \u2192\u2113is an observable (quasiobservable) on a logic (quasilogic) \u2113, and m : \u2113\u2192R+ is a measure on \u2113, then the composition n = m \u25e6h is a distribution on B, which is \u03c4-additive if m and h are. In particular, if B is\na semiring of events with unity 1 \u2208B and a state p : \u2113\u2192[0, 1] is given, then w = p \u25e6h is a probability distribution on B, if h(1) belongs to the support of this state, i.e. w(1) = p(h(1)) = 1. Such distribution, describing the probabilities of observable events b \u2208B, defines a statistical state on the semiring B, corresponding with the measurement h in a system, described by the logic \u2113with the given state p. In general, an arbitrary \u03c4-distribution n : B \u2192R+ on a semiring B is called \u03c4-representable, if there exist some \u03c4-homomorphism h : B \u2192A into some \u03c4-ring A \u2286A(X) and a \u03c4-measure \u00b5 : A \u2192R+, such that n = \u00b5 \u25e6h. According to the theorem on the representation of boolean semirings (the Stone theorem for boolean algebras), proved in the preceding section, each distribution n is finitely-representable on some locally compact space X, that can be chosen as the space X0 of the universal representation h0 : B \u2192A0, extending the finite-additive distribution \u03bd0 = n \u25e6h\u22121 0 from the semiring B0 = h0(B) to the measure \u00b50 : A0 \u2192R+ on the ring A0, by additivity. However, by \u03c4 = \u03c3, not every \u03c4-distribution is \u03c3-representable in the described sense, because, in general, no universal \u03c3-isomorphism of an arbitrary \u03c3-ring B into some field A(X) exists. It is therefore natural to generalize the notion of representability of a \u03c4-distribution n : B \u2192R+, calling it factor-representable, if a \u03c4-measure \u00b5 : A \u2192R+ and a \u03c4-homomorphism h : B \u2192A/\u2206into a factor-algebra of some \u03c4-ring A \u2286A(X) by some \u03c4-ideal \u2206\u2282A of subsets A \u2208\u2206of zero measure \u00b5(A) = 0 exist, such that n = m \u25e6h, where m is a \u03c4-measure on A/\u2206, determining \u00b5 = m \u25e6j by the factorisation homomorphism j : A \u2192A/\u2206. According to the theorem 3, any \u03c3-distribution is factor-representable on some locally compact space X with a \u03c3-measure \u00b5, that vanishes on a \u03c3-ideal of subsets of the first category, because as (X, \u00b5) it is always possible to choose the space X0 of the universal factor-representation h\u03c3 : B \u2192A\u03c3/\u2206\u03c3 and the \u03c3-measure \u00b5\u03c3 : A\u03c3 \u2192R+, that is the extension of the measure \u00b50 from the ring A0 to the \u03c3-complete ring A\u03c3 = A0 \u2228\u2206\u03c3. For \u03c4 > \u03c3, \u03c4-distributions n : B \u2192R+ exist that are not factorrepresentable, even if B is a boolean \u03c4-algebra; however, if n is factorrepresentable, then the space X can be always chosen locally compact, for example, X0 with the smallest \u03c4-ring A\u03c4 \u2287A0 and the \u03c4-ideal \u2206\u03c4 \u2286A\u03c4, putting h = j\u03c4 \u25e6h0. The corresponding \u03c4-measure \u00b5\u03c4 : A\u03c4 \u2192R+ is the extension by \u03c4-additivity of the measure \u00b50 from the ring A0 to the \u03c4-complete ring A\u03c4 = A0 \u2228\u2206\u03c4, that is, as in the case \u03c4 = \u03c3, completely\nregular \u00b5\u03c4 = sup{\u00b5\u03c4(K) : K \u2286A, k \u2208K} for any A \u2208A, with respect to the family K of the compact subsets of the space X0. The last follows from the condition of \u03c4-approximity of the family K\u03c4 \u2286K of the \u03c4-closed compact subsets K \u2208K \u2229A\u03c4 = K\u03c4 of the ring A\u03c4. In general, if X is a locally compact space and \u00b5 : A \u2192R+ is a measure on some boolean ring A \u2282A(X) with the property of approximity with respect to some family K of compact subsets K \u2208A, then \u00b5 is a \u03c3-measure and it can be always extended to a regular measure \u00af\u00b5 on the completion \u00af A = A \u2228\u00af\u2206of the ring A with the compact subsets K \u2208\u00af\u2206of measure 0 : \u00af\u00b5(K) = inf{\u00b5(A) : A \u2283K, A \u2208A}.\n# 3 Quantum systems\n# 3.1 Hilbertian clans\nQuantum systems, which are, strictly speaking, any physical systems, due to the uncertainty principle, are usually described by a Hilbert space E, the subspaces of which H \u2286E form a quantum logic with respect to inclusion: H1 \u2264H2 if H1 \u2286H2, and orthogonal complement \u00afH = H\u22a5. The quantum logic L(E) of all subspaces H \u2208L(E) has a zero - the one-dimensional (zerodimensional) subspace O = {0}, a unit - the whole space E \u2208L(E), it contains the greatest lower bound\nand, consequently, also the least upper bound\nfor an arbitrary family Hi \u2286E, i \u2208I. The latter logical structure is nondistributive, except in the trivial case of the one-dimensional E, as can be easily seen taking into account any nonorthogonal subspaces H1, H1 intersecting only in zero, H1 \u2227H2 = 0, which describe nonsimultaneous but not disjoint propositions, for example, eigensubspaces H\u2206p, H\u2206q, of the momentum operator \u02c6p and the coordinate operator \u02c6q of a quantum mechanical particle, corresponding to finite values p \u2208\u2206p, q \u2208\u2206q. In particular, this indicates\nthat the quantum logic L(E) is not equivalent, by dimH > 1, to any boolean algebra, and it cannot be represented by any field of subsets of a set X, i.e., a quantum system cannot be described in a classical way in terms of a phase space X. From the algebraic point of view, it is appropriate to identify propositions of a quantum logic L(E) not with the subspaces H \u2286E, but with the corresponding orthogonal projections P : \u03be \u2208E \ufffd\u2192P\u03be \u2208H onto the subspace H = PE, which are characterized, in the algebra B(E) of all bounded linear operators A in E, as selfadjoint idempotents\nThe logical partial operations of substraction, addition and multiplication of propositions are described by the algebraic operations A \u2212B, A + B, AB, defined in the logic L(E) of all orthoprojections of the space E for comparable in the sense AB = B, orthogonal in the sense AB = 0, and commuting in the sense AB = BA, couples A, B \u2208L(E), respectively. We note that also any boolean algebra can be represented in this way, if we assigne to the elements a \u2208A e.g. the orthoprojectors on the Hilbert subspaces Ha \u2282E of square summable functions x \ufffd\u2192\u03be(x) on the set X of maximal ideals of the algebra A with carriers h(a) \u2286X, defined by the Stone representation a \ufffd\u2192h(a).The corresponding subset of orthoprojections Pa \u2208L(E) is commutative, and forms a boolean ring with unit with respect the operations of conjunction A \u2227B = AB, difference A \\ B = A \u2212AB and disjunction\nIt is not difficult to see that this ring may be defined as the set of selfadjoint idempotents of a commutative subalgebra A \u2282B(H) of operators of pointwise multiplication A\u03be(x) = \u03b1(x)\u03be(x) by bounded number valued functions x \ufffd\u2192\u03b1(x). In general, we will call a clan an arbitrary logic L \u2282L(E) of orthoprojections, consisting of selfadjoint idempotents of any \u2217-algebra A \u2282B(E) of bounded operators A \u2208A \u21d2A\u2217\u2208A containing an orthoprojector P \u0338= 0 as the algebraic unit:\nA clan L is \u03c4-complete if A is a \u03c4-complete algebra, that is, if any downward directed set {Ai} \u2282A of positive operators Ai \u22650 has in A the infimum\n\ufffdAi \u2208A, and is complete if A is a complete \u2217-algebra, for example, a von Neumann algebra. A Banach \u03c3-complete \u2217-algebra A is called a Baer \u2217algebra; the corresponding clan L \u2282A consists of carriers of the operators A \u2208A, i.e., the smallest orthoprojections in E, E \u2208L(E), such that EA = A = AE. The following theorem shows that if any pair P1, P2 of orthoprojections in a clan L for which P1 \u2227P2 = 0 is orthogonal, then the clan is a boolean algebra.\nFrom the proof of Theorem 4 it also follows that if the suppositions of the theorem are satisfied, the set L of orthoprojections is commutative and, therefore, it is a clan of some commutative algebra A.\n# 3.2 Quantum states\nIf L(E) is a quantum logic of orthoprojections in a Hilbert space E with a scalar product (\u03be, \u03be), then for any vector \u03be \u2208E, the formula \u03c1\u03be(A) = (A\u03be, \u03be) defines a positive completely additive mapping \u03c1\u03be : L \u2192[0, 1], which is a state on L, if P\u03be = \u03be for the unit P of the logic L. In general, any linear functional \u03c1 on a \u2217-algebra A \u2282B(E) with a unit P, satisfying condition of positivity \u03c1(A) \u22650 whenever a \u22650, is called a distribution on A, since it defines a measure m(A) = \u03c1(A) on the clan L of orthoprojections of the algebra. The measure m is bounded: \u2225m\u2225= m(P), and it is a \u03c4-measure if the functional \u03c1 satisfies the condition \u2227i\u2208I\u03c1(Ai) = 0 for any decreasing Ai \u21930 family {Ai}i\u2208I, |I| \u2264\u03c4, of operators Ai \u2208A. A distribution \u03c1 is called a vector distribution if \u03c1(A) = (A\u03be, \u03be) = \u03c1\u03be(A) for some vector \u03be \u2208E. Any convex combination of vector distributions is a normal distribution, which defines a normal measure on L, because then \ufffd i\u2208I \u03c1(Ai) = 0 if Ai \u21930 for any I. We will consider now an arbitrary (abstract) \u201calgebra of observables\u201d A, defined as complex linear space with an operation of associative multiplication\n(a + b)\u2217= a\u2217+ b\u2217, (ab)\u2217= b\u2217a\u2217, (\u03bba)\u2217= \u00af\u03bba\u2217.\nAssume that in A, a relation of partial ordering is defined, satisfying t conditions a \u2264c \u21d2a + b \u2264c + b, b\u2217ab \u2264b\u2217cb; \u03bba \u2264\u03bbc\na \u2264c \u21d2a + b \u2264c + b, b\u2217ab \u2264b\u2217cb; \u03bba \u2264\u03bbc\nfor any b \u2208A and \u03bb \u22650, and let for any a \u2208A there is a self adjoint idempotent e \u22650 in A such that ea = a = ae. Since a\u2217a = a\u2217ea \u22650 for any a \u2208A, the positive cone A+ = {a \u22650} of the algebra A contains all elements of the form a\u2217a, in particular, all selfadjoint idempotents, which form an upward directed subset \u2113of the cone A+, since for any e1, e2 \u2208\u2113 there exists e \u2208\u2113, e \u2265ei, i = 1, 2, determined by the condition ea = a = ae for a = e1 + ie2. It is not difficult to verify that the set \u2113\u2282A is a logic with the order relation e1 \u2264e2 if e1e2 = e1, commutation relation e1\u00af\u2193e2 if e1e2 = e2e1, and orthogonality relation e1 \u22a5e2 if e1e2 = 0, without a logical\nunit, in general, which is \u03c4-complete, if the cone A+ is \u03c4-complete in the sense \ufffd i\u2208I ai \u2208A+ for any decreasing set {ai}i\u2208I \u2282A+ of cardinality |I| \u2264\u03c4. A distribution on an algebra of observables A is any linear functional r : A \u2192C, satisfying condition of positivity r(a) \u22650 whenever a \u22650; if in addition, \u2227r(ai) = 0 for any \u03c4-family {ai} \u2282A+ decreasing to zero, then r is called a \u03c4-distribution (normal distribution if the latter condition holds for any cardinal \u03c4). Distributions on an algebra A, with a logic \u2113\u2282A as an approximative unit, are defined by their values on the set of elements of the form a\u2217a, since every self adjoint element a = a\u2217can be written in the form a = a+ \u2212a\u2212, where a\u00b1 = 1 4(a \u00b1 e)2, where e\u2217= e = e2 \u2208\u2113satisfies the condition ea = a = ae. The restriction m = r|\u2113defines, evidently, a measure on \u2113, which is a \u03c4-measure if r is a \u03c4-distribution. A state on A is any distribution r, iducing a state on \u2113, i.e., a probability measure, for which r(e) = 1 for some e \u2208\u2113. If all elements a = a\u2217are normed by the functional\nwhere e \u2208\u2113is any idempotent, satisfying the condition eae = a, then by Hahn-Banach theorem there exists a sufficiently rich set of states to satisfy the condition r(a) = 1 for any a\u2217= a for which \u2225a\u2225= 1, and, in particular, the condition r(e) = 1 for any nonzero e \u2208\u2113. This condition is satisfied by any normed algebra of observables A such that \u2225a\u2225= \u2225aa\u2217\u22251/2, called a C\u2217algebra if it is a Banach algebra, in particular, any \u2217-subalgebra A \u2282B(E) of bounded operators, acting on some pre-Hilbert space E. As it follows from the construction in the following paragraph, this case actually describes all algebras of observables A normed by elements e \u2208\u2113.\n# 3.3 Quantum representations\nA representation of a partially ordered \u2217-algebra A is any \u2217-homomorphism of this algebra into an operator \u2217-algebra B(E) of some pre-Hilbert space E, that is, a linear mapping \u03c0 : A \u2192B(E), for which\n\u03c0(ab) = \u03c0(a)\u03c0(b), \u03c0(a\u2217) = \u03c0(a)\u2217, a \u22650 \u21d2\u03c0(a) \u22650.\nAny representation \u03c0 defines a homomorphism of the logic \u2113\u2282A into the logic L(E) of all orthoprojections of the space E, which is a \u03c4-homomorphism\n(normal homomorphism) if \ufffd i\u2208I \u03c0(ai) = 0 for any decreasing to 0, ai \u21930, family {ai} of cardinality \u03c4 (of any cardinality). It turns out that any logical state on \u2113, defined by an algebraic state r : A \u2192C, is described in the corresponding representation by a normed vector \u03be1 \u2208E, and this representation is a \u03c4-representation (a normal representation) if r is a \u03c4-state (a normal state). We will bring a construction of such representation, which is a generalization of the well-known GNS-construction to the case of an arbitrary \u2217-algebra A. Let r be a state on A and element e1 \u2208\u2113satisfy condition r(e1) = 1. Denote by E the set of classes\nof elements a\u2032 equivalent to a\u2217with respect to the kernel N = {a : r(aa\u2217) = 0} of the hermitian form \u27e8b|a\u27e9= r(ba\u2217) on A, where we put a\u2032 \u2243a\u2217if a\u2032 \u2212a\u2217\u2208N . This set forms a pre-Hilbert space with respect to the scalar product (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u27e8b|a\u27e9= \u03b7\u2217\u03be, where \u03b7\u2217\u2261\u27e8b| is a linear functional |a\u27e9\ufffd\u2192 r(ba\u2217), corresponding to the vector \u03b7 = |b\u27e9. To every b \u2208A, we define a linear operator \u03c0r(b) : |a\u27e9\ufffd\u2192|ab\u2217\u27e9, having an adjoint \u03c0r(b)\u2217= \u03c0r(b\u2217) on E, in correspondence with the equality\n(\u03c0r(b)\u03be, \u03be) = \u27e8a|ab\u2217\u27e9= r(aba\u2217) = \u27e8ab|a\u27e9= (\u03be, \u03c0r(b\u2217)\u03be), \u2200\u03be \u2208E.\nThe mapping \u03c0r : b \u2192\u03c0(b) is, evidently, linear, multiplicative \u03c0r(b1b2)|a\u27e9= |a(b1b2)\u2217\u27e9= |ab\u2217 2b\u2217 1\u27e9= \u03c0r(b1)\u03c0r(b2)|a\u27e9,\n\u03c0r(b1b2)|a\u27e9= |a(b1b2)\u2217\u27e9= |ab\u2217 2b\u2217 1\u27e9= \u03c0r(b1)\u03c0r(b2)|a\u27e9,\npreserves order, and \u2227(\u03c0r(ai)\u03be, \u03be) = 0 whenever ai \u21930, |I| \u2264\u03c4, and r is \u03c4-normal. In this way, we construct a \u03c4-normal representation of an algebra A with an approximative unit \u2113\u2282A. It remains to find a vector in E, describing the given state on \u2113. We prove that we can take any vector \u03be1 = |e1\u27e9, where e1 \u2208A is a self-adjoint idempotent, satisfying the condition r(e1) = supe\u2208\u2113r(e),i.e., we have the representation r(a) = \u27e8e1|\u03c0r(a)|e1\u27e9= r(a1ae1)\nfor any a \u2208A.\nIndeed, due to the directedness of the set \u2113, for any a \u2208A there exists a self-adjoint idempotent e \u2208\u2113, majorating e1, such that ea = a = ae. It follows that\nTheorem 5 Let \u2113be a logic of self-adjoint idempotents, which is an approximative unit of a \u2217-algebra A, and \u03c1 : \u2113\u2192[0, 1] be a probability state on \u2113, defined by some \u03c4-normal distribution r on A, \u03c1 = r/\u2113. Then there exist a pre-Hilbert space E, a \u03c4-normal representation \u03c0 : A \u2192B(E) and a normed vector \u03be1 \u2208E, which defines a state as a vector state on the clan of the orthoprojectors\nLet us note that in case that an injective representation \u03c0 exists, obtained, e.g., by the described construction for a strictly positive (faithful) distribution r, the quasilogic \u2113of the algebra A is isomorphic to the clan L of the operator algebra A = \u03c0(A), and can be identified with it. In particular, for any algebra of observables A, normed by the logic \u2113\u2282A, there exists a faithful \u03c4-representation \u2295\u03c0r in the Hilbert space \u2295Er = H, the completion of the direct sum \u2295Er over all states r : A \u2192C.\n# 3.4 Quantum observables\nLet L be a clan of orthoprojections, representing a quantum logic of a system in a Hilbert space E of vectors \u03be \u2208E of quantum states, and H be a Hilbert space, describing another quantum system, which is accessible to observations. Any mapping \u03c1F : L \u2192B(H) of the form\nwhere F : H \u2192E is a linear operator whose adjoint on E is F \u2217, F \u2217E \u2286 H, will be called an operator distribution on the clan L with respect to the Hilbert space H . A distribution \u03c1 is called an operator state if F is an isometric embedding of H into E: F \u2217F = I and FF \u2217\u2286P for some orthoprojector P \u2208L. In the case of one-dimensional space H = C, the operator distribution (state) coincides with the vector distribution (state) defined by the one-dimensional operator F = \u03be : \u03b1 \u2208C \ufffd\u2192\u03b1\u03be \u2208E. Any operator distribution \u03c1F on L defines a positive completely additive normal mapping\nwhich maps some orthoprojection P \u2208L to the identity operator I of H:\nA triple (E, L, F), where F is an operator of a state \u03c1F on L, will be called a quantum operator- probability space (quantum probability system), and simply a quantum probability space if F = \u03be is a vector of the state (H is one-dimensional). Let B be a semiring (ring) with unit E, describing events B \u2208B that can be observed in a quantum system (E, L, F) \u201con the scale of the measuring device E\u201d. Any homomorphism h : B \u2192L, for which h(E)F = F, induces for any normed vector \u03b7 \u2208H, a probability state on B described by the measure\nand is called a quantum observable in the system (E, L, F). The mapping\nand is called a quantum observable in the system (E, L, F). The mapping\ndefined by a quantum observable h, evidently, is positive and additive, satisfies condition mF(B) \u2264I, where I, where I is the unit operator in H. The\nhomomorphism from a Boolean ring B into the quasilogic [0, I] \u2282B(H) of positive operators A \u2264I on the Hilbert space H, satisfying the normalization condition mF(E) = I, is called quasiobservable over B. Any quasiobservable m : B \u2192[0, I], which defines probability distributions m\u03b7(B) = (M(B)\u03b7, \u03b7) corresponding to unit vectors \u03b7 \u2208H, will be called an operator-valued probability distribution (o.p.d.) on B, or a weak quantum observable in the Hilbert space H. Quantum observables in the category of \u03c4-semirings B are described by \u03c4-homomorphisms h into the operator \u03c4- clans L \u2282B(E), inducing operator-valued probability \u03c4-distributions\nas the weak quantum observables in H, and they are normal in case of normal\n2. \u03c4-additivity: (m(B)\u03b7, \u03b7) = \ufffd(m(bi)\u03b7, \u03b7), \u2200\u03b7 \u2208H, where B = \ufffdBi is any disjoint sum of cardinality |I| \u2264\u03c4.\nThen there is a quantum probability space (E, L, F) and a \u03c4-homomorphism h : B \u2192L such that h(E)F = F, inducing the distribution m:\ncanonically determined on a minimal Hilbert space E generated by the vectors h(B)F\u03b7, B \u2208B, \u03b7 \u2208H. If h1 and h2 are equivalent observables on minimal spaces E1 and E2, then there is a unitary transformation U : E1 \u2192E2, UF1 = F2,\nProof First we prove the positive definiteness \ufffd j,l(m(BjBl)\u03b7l, \u03b7j) \u22650 of any operator-valued matrix [kj,l]n j,l=1, m(BjBl) = kj,l. Indeed, for any finite set {Bj} of elements Bj, j = 1, 2, ..., n of the semiring B, there exists a finite partition Bj = \ufffd B\u2208Aj B of mutually disjoint elements B \u2208B from an index set (the same for all Bj) A \u2282B, Aj \u2286A, \u2200j = 1, 2, ..., n. Defining \u03b7B,j = \u03b7j, if B \u2208Aj, and \u03b7B,j = 0, if B /\u2208Aj, and taking into account that BjBl = \ufffd B\u2208Aj\u2229Al B, we obtain\nowing to positivity (1). Let E denote the Hilbert space obtained by factorization and completion of the formal linear envelope of the cartesian product B\u00d7H with scalar multiplication \u03bb(B, \u03b7) \ufffd\u2192(B, \u03bb\u03b7) with respect to hermitian\nDenote by | \ufffd j(Bj, \u03b7j)\u27e9the corresponding equivalence classes, and we express the above scalar product in the form (\u03be\u2032, \u03be) = \u03be\u2217\u03be\u2032, where \u03be\u2217= \u27e8 \ufffd j(Bj, \u03b7j)| is the linear functional corresponding to the vector \u03be = | \ufffd j(Bj, \u03b7j)\u27e9. Linear operator F : \u03b7 \ufffd\u2192|(E, \u03b7)\u27e9defines an isometric embedding H \u2192E due to the equality\nThe operator h(B) is selfadjoint owing to commutativity of the semiring B, and idempotent owing to B2 = B, B \u2208B. Moreover, h(E)F\u03b7 = h(E)|(E, \u03b7)\u27e9= |(E, \u03b7)\u27e9= F\u03b7,\nU : h1(B)F1\u03b7 \ufffd\u2192h2(B)F2\u03b7\nis isometric on the generating vectors, and extends to a unitary transformation U : E1 \u2192E2 with the desired properties. The proof is complete.\nAcknowledgement I am very grateful to Professor Sylvia Pulmanova for the hospitality in Liptovski Jan and the encouragement to publish the Chapter 2 of my untraslated book as the contributed paper. During the conference and the discussion we found that some structures, such as qusilogics and quasiobservables introduced in this chapter, have been rediscovered then in the fuzzy logics and the measure theory on diposets. I am indebted to Sylvia Pulmanova for pointing me out an omission of the axiom b\u2212(b \u2212a) = a in the definition of the quasilogics in the Russion edition of the book and for the completion of the proof of the last Theorem. I also wish to thank to her daughter, Anna for the marvellous translation of this chapter from Russian into English, and the TEX setting of the paper.\n# References\n",
