You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting comparative information about various methods described in a given text. The text contains one main chapter and multiple sub-chapters. Each sub-chapter focuses on a specific method, and its title represents the name of the method. Your goal is to:  

### Tasks  

1. **Identify Common Comparative Attributes**:  
   - Analyze the text to identify 3 key attributes that are shared across all methods.  
   - The attributes must be **representative**, **suitable for comparison**, and **easy to understand**.  
   - Avoid attributes that are too narrow or irrelevant for comparison.  

2. **Summarize Method Features**:  
   - For each method (represented by sub-chapter titles), provide concise and **specific** descriptions for each identified attribute.  
   - Avoid vague or ambiguous phrases; the descriptions should clearly reflect the unique features of the method.  
   - Limit each description to **no more than 4 words**.  

3. **Output Format**:  
   - Present your results in the following dictionary format:  
     - `"common_attributes"`: A list of the identified common attributes.  
     - `"methods"`: A dictionary where each key is a method name, and its value is another dictionary mapping the common attributes to specific feature descriptions.  

Your response should be enclosed within `<Answer>` and `</Answer>` tags.

### Example Output  
<Answer> 
{{
  "common_attributes": ["Optimization Scope", "Optimization Method", "Model Compatibility"],
  "methods": {{
    "Prompt Tuning": {{
      "Optimization Scope": "Input Embeddings",
      "Optimization Method": "Direct optimization",
      "Model Compatibility": "T5"
    }},
    "Prefix Tuning": {{
      "Optimization Scope": "All Layers",
      "Optimization Method": "FFN optimization",
      "Model Compatibility": "GPT"
    }},
    "P-tuning": {{
      "Optimization Scope": "Input Sequence",
      "Optimization Method": "LSTM-based encoder",
      "Model Compatibility": "All models"
    }}
  }}
}}

```  

### Guidelines  

#### Key Attribute Extraction  
- Ensure attributes are **broad but specific** enough to describe all methods in a comparable way.  
- Focus on attributes that enhance **representativeness**, **comparability**, and **clarity** .  


#### Feature Filling  
- Provide **specific and clear** content for each attribute. Avoid generic terms such as "Flexible" or "Efficient" unless they are precisely defined in the context.  
- If certain features are not explicitly mentioned in the text, use "Not specified" as a placeholder.  

**Instructions**: Use this format and guidelines to analyze the provided text and generate the comparative information.
