1. **Size**: The total amount of data included in the benchmark. If the provided information does not specify the size, return "-".  
2. **Domain**: The specific application domains covered by the benchmark (e.g., mathematics, coding). Extract only one primary domains.  
3. **Task Format**: The specific types of tasks included in the benchmark (e.g., Question Answering, text classification). Extract only one main task types.  
4. **Metric**: The evaluation metrics used in the benchmark (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). Extract one or two primary metrics. If the metric name has a corresponding abbreviation, please use the abbreviation. For example, for "Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10)", the output should be "MRR@10". 

Output the results in the form of a dictionary.  

Your response should be enclosed within `<Answer>` and `</Answer>` tags.
