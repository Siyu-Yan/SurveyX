It is designed to engage in natural language conversations with users, offering responses that are coherent and contextually relevant. AI Tool builds upon the success of previous iterations,  such as GPT-2 and GPT-3, incorporating improvements in training methodologies and model architecture. The model utilizes a transformer neural network, which is a deep learning architecture that excels at processing sequential data, such as text. Transformers allow AI Tool to capture long-range dependencies and understand the context of a conversation, making it capable of generating human-like responses. AI Tool has been trained on a massive data-set of text and code, which allows it to have a broad understanding of language and knowledge. This allows AI Tool to respond to a wide range of prompts and questions, including those that are open ended, challenging, or strange. AI Tool is still under development, but it has the potential to be a powerful tool for a variety of applications, such as customer service, education, and research [1]. Table.1 illustrates the evolution of AI chatbots with their properties.  AI Tool has been trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet, encompassing  a wide range of topics and domains. This training data enables the model to have a broad  understanding of language, facts, and cultural knowledge. However, it is important to  note that AI Tool does not possess real-time information and its knowledge is based on  data available up until September 2021 [2]. OpenAI has made efforts to ensure that AI \nCitation: Mohapatra H., Mishra S.R.

During training, the model is fine-tuned and guided using a combination of human reviewers and reinforcement learning algorithms to align its responses with desired ethical standards. Despite these efforts, the model may occasionally produce incorrect, nonsensical, or biased responses [3].  AI Tool is a large language model (LLM) that can be used for a variety of purposes, including answering questions, providing explanations, assisting with tasks, generating ideas, and engaging in creative writing [4]. It has found applications in customer support, content generation, language learning, brainstorming, and more. OpenAI has made AI Tool accessible through various interfaces, including web-based platforms and API services. This allows developers and users to interact with the model and integrate it into their own applications or services [5]. \n# 1.1. Working of AI Tool \nThe transformer model consists of layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-  forward neural networks, enabling it to capture complex patterns and dependencies in  language. Here\u2019s a simplified overview of how AI Tool works is illustrated in Figure.1. The  first step is tokenization where the input text is divided into tokens, which can be as small  as individual characters or as large as whole words. Each token is assigned a numerical  representation. The second step is encoding where the tokens are passed through an initial  embedding layer, where they are transformed into high-dimensional vectors that capture  their semantic meaning. The third step is self-Attention where the encoded tokens are then  processed through multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms. Self-attention allows the  model to weigh the importance of each token based on its relationship with other tokens in  the input sequence. This helps the model understand the context and dependencies within  the text. The fourth step is feed-forward networks where after the self-attention layers,  the output is passed through a series of feed-forward neural networks. These networks  apply non-linear transformations to the token representations, further capturing complex  patterns in the data. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/c614/c614f488-047b-4b96-837a-21c705d281a7.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1. Architecture of AI-Tool</div>\nDuring the decoding phase the final output of the feed-forward networks is passed through a decoding layer, which maps the representations back to the vocabulary space. This allows the model to generate the next token or predict the most likely token given the context. After that during response generation the conversation happens where, AI Tool takes a user\u2019s input and generates a response based on the learned patterns and dependencies in the training data. The model generates tokens one by one, taking into account the preceding context and user input. This process continues until an appropriate response is generated or a maximum response length is reached. Training AI Tool involves a two-step process. Such as  1.  Pre-training: The model is trained on a large corpus of text from the internet. By  predicting the next token in a sentence, the model learns to understand language and  capture various patterns and concepts. This pre-training allows AI Tool to acquire a  broad knowledge of language and facts.  2.  Fine-tuning: After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned using a more specific dataset, which includes demonstrations and comparisons by human reviewers. OpenAI provides guidelines to the reviewers to ensure the model\u2019s responses align with \ndesired behavior and ethical standards. This fine-tuning helps shape the model\u2019s  behavior and allows it to produce more appropriate and controlled responses.  The main idea behind the transformer is to capture the relationships between different  words or tokens in a sentence, allowing for better context understanding and generation.  The transformer model consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. In  the context of Chat boat, the encoder processes the input message and the conversation  history, while the decoder generates the response. The encoder and decoder are composed  of multiple layers, with each layer containing sub-modules. Let\u2019s focus on one layer to  understand the core workings of the Transformer.  Self-Attention Mechanism: Self-attention is a mechanism that allows the model to  weigh the importance of each word/token in the input sequence. For each word/token,  self-attention computes its \"attention scores\" with respect to all other words/tokens in the  sequence. These attention scores determine how much focus the model should place on  each word/token during processing. The attention scores are computed using three learned  matrices: Query, Key, and Value. These are multiplied together to produce the attention  scores. Multi-Head Attention: To capture different types of dependencies and improve  performance, self-attention is applied in parallel multiple times, known as \"heads.\" Each  attention head learns different relationships between words/tokens, allowing the model to  attend to various aspects of the input. The outputs of all attention heads are concatenated  and linearly transformed to retain relevant information.  Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks: After self-attention, the output is passed  through a position-wise feed-forward network. This network consists of two linear layers  with a non-linear activation function in between, allowing the model to transform and  combine information across positions. Residual Connections and Layer Normalization: To  address the challenge of vanishing gradients, residual connections are added, allowing  the model to retain information from previous layers. Layer normalization is applied after  each sub-module, ensuring stable gradients during training. The encoder processes the  input message and conversation history by stacking multiple layers of self-attention and  feed-forward networks. The decoder, on the other hand, also incorporates an additional  attention mechanism that attends over the encoder\u2019s output to capture relevant context  information. During training, the model is optimized to generate coherent and contextually  appropriate responses using techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation. The  parameters of the model are learned by minimizing the discrepancy between the model\u2019s  generated responses and the ground truth responses in the training data.  The paper\u2019s structure is outlined below. Section 2 provides an in-depth examination of  the related literature. In Section 3, we delve into our exploration using the AI tool. Technical  domains and specific applications are thoroughly discussed in Section 4, while Section 5  similarly addresses business and administrative sectors along with pertinent applications.  Section 6 provides a concise overview of observations and performance evaluations with  behavioral analysis of the AI tool followed by the conclusion and references. \n# 2. Related Work\nAI Tool has gained significant attention worldwide and sparked discussions in academia. Some individuals foresee potential disruptions, such as the decline of assigned essays and  widespread unemployment as machines assume writing tasks. There are concerns re-  garding the prevalence of cheating, with worries that it may become challenging or even  impossible to detect. Moreover, fears persist that students may become complacent, con-  vinced that they can rely entirely on automated writing. This article aims to provide a  concise and accurate overview of AI Tool, including its capabilities and limitations. Ad-  ditionally, it explores methods for identifying AI-driven cheating, as well as potential  applications that could alleviate workload, enhance students\u2019 writing skills, facilitate exam composition and grading, and elevate the quality of research papers [6].  In this commentary, we delve into the subject of AI Tool and offer our insights regard-  ing its potential usefulness in systematic reviews (SRs). We assess the appropriateness and \napplicability of AI Tool\u2019s responses to prompts related to SRs. The rise of artificial intel-  ligence (AI)-assisted technologies has prompted discussions on their current capabilities,  limitations, and opportunities for integration into scientific endeavors. Large language  models (LLMs), such as OpenAI\u2019s AI Tool, have garnered significant attention due to their  ability to generate natural-sounding responses across various prompts. SRs, which rely  on secondary data and often demand substantial time and financial resources, present an  attractive domain for the development of AI-assistive technologies. On February 6, 2023,  the PICO Portal developers conducted a webinar to explore how AI Tool responds to tasks  associated with SR methodology. Based on our exploration of AI Tool\u2019s responses, we  observe that while AI Tool and LLMs show promise in assisting with SR-related tasks, the  technology is still in its early stages and requires significant further development for such  applications [7].  The application of AI Tool can be used in multiple discipline of science. The aim was  to explore the application of AI in various tasks within the mechanical engineering domain  and draw conclusions through statistical analysis of the outcomes. However, when utilizing  AI Tool in several calculation examples, we discovered that it generated incorrect results,  erroneous formulas, and similar inaccuracies [8]. The firing appropriate query can help to  use the AI Tool in software development and modelling too. AI Tool has demonstrated its  capability to generate useful code snippets that, on occasion, are correct and successfully  accomplish the desired task specified by the user. Moreover, AI Tool exhibits familiarity  with various textual modeling languages, including domain-specific languages (DSLs).  Notably, the example of GraphGPT showcases the potential for language designers to  instruct AI Tool on the desired structure of a modeling language, resulting in the generation  of code fragments within that language. In the case of GraphGPT, it employs a clever  approach of requesting a JSON-encoded representation of the graph, which can then be  rendered into a diagram. The possibilities for leveraging generative AI in modeling are  vast, and the exact ways in which it will transform the business and practices of modeling  in the future remain uncertain[9]. The uses of AI Tool can also be found in scientific abstract  writing [10] and in health sector [11] too.  In the field of academic writing AI Tool can be used in revolutionary way [12]. As  AI Tool is a new tool hence many researchers is trying to explore it in a several way. One  such method is chat with AI Tool where the authors have shared their experience [13].  Though AI Tool is a powerful tool that can be used in many applications but there are  several instance where the faulty references can be found [14]. Since its launch in 2022,  AI Tool, a query-oriented language generation tool, has garnered significant attention.  Although the initial excitement may have waned, the impact of AI Tool has sparked  lasting structural changes. Notably, academic journals have published papers with AI Tool  listed as an author, while certain educational institutions have opted to prohibit its use  due to concerns about potential misuse. Criticisms of AI Tool have primarily revolved  around its inaccuracies, often labeling it as a \"bullshit generator.\" Additionally, some  have highlighted the undesirable consequences that arise from its utilization, such as the  potential to undermine creativity. However, we contend that there is an unaddressed issue  at hand\u2014the fundamental ideas and politics that drive the development of these tools and  facilitate their uncritical adoption [15]. \n# 3. Exploration with AI Tool \nThe scope of AI tools is vast and extends across diverse sectors, revolutionizing the  way we approach challenges and opportunities.

In healthcare, AI aids in diagnosing diseases and personalizing treatment plans,  while  in finance, it enhances fraud detection and market analysis. Industries like manufactur-  ing benefit from AI-driven automation for improved efficiency, and the entertainment  sector leverages AI to create immersive experiences. The ability of AI tools to analyze  vast data-sets, recognize patterns, and make informed decisions transcends boundaries, \nmaking them an indispensable asset in shaping the present and future of countless sectors [16]. The study has focused on two types of sector classification such as technical and business administrative sectors respectively. Further, each type of category have considered 5 different types of individual sectors for response analysis. \nTechnical Sectors  \u2022  Medical and Health Case Sector  \u2022  Software Development  \u2022  Smart Agriculture  \u2022  Logistics and Supply  \u2022  Smart City Designing \n# 4.

The proposed metric includes following parameters like accuracy (A), relevance (R), coherence (C), grammaticality (G), and fluency (F). This metric can be used to assess how well the generated responses align with the desired outcomes and user expectations. We have compared the human ratings with system-generated responses to gauge the model\u2019s performance and identify areas for refinement. The graph shows the performance of different AI tool responses for different domains. The red line represents the accuracy of the responses, while the blue line represents the relevance of the responses. The green line represents the coherence of the responses, the orange line represents the grammaticality of the responses, and the purple line represents the fluency of the responses. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/d602/d6024d41-21ff-4ee8-9382-a1a7e9066a0a.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4. AI Tool\u2019s performance evaluation metric</div>\nThe graph shows that the accuracy and relevance of AI tool responses vary depending on the domain. For example, AI tool responses are more accurate and relevant in the health domain than in the entertainment domain. This is likely because there is more structured data available in the health domain, which makes it easier for AI tools to learn and generate accurate and relevant responses. The graph also shows that the coherence, grammaticality, and fluency of AI tool responses are generally good across all domains. However, there is some variation, with the best scores in the academic domain and the worst scores in the crime domain. This is likely because the academic domain requires more complex and nuanced language, while the crime domain requires more factual and objective language. Overall, the graph shows that AI tool responses are generally performing well across a variety of domains. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in terms of accuracy and relevance in some domains.  Each metric is assigned a score ranging from 0 to 1, where a higher score indicates  better performance. These scores represent the average assessment of AI Tool\u2019s responses  based on the evaluation process conducted. The mathematical expression to calculate the  overall score (OS) is represented in Eq.1. Table.2 illustrates the performance evaluation of  AI Tool responses by using Eq.1. \nThe complexity of AI Tool responses have been calculated by using two primary  parameters such as \u2019L\u2019 be the average sentence length in words and \u2019W\u2019 be the average  word length in characters. The complexity \u2019C\u2019 can be presented by using Eq.2. \nTable.1 shows the overall performance evaluation of the AI tool for all responses from all considered sectors. The table shows the metric accuracy, relevance, coherence, grammaticality, and fluency scores for all responses from all considered sectors. The accuracy score measures how well the AI tool\u2019s responses match the ground truth. The \n(1)\n(2)\nrelevance score measures how well the AI tool\u2019s responses are relevant to the query. The  coherence score measures how well the AI tool\u2019s responses are structured and easy to  understand. The grammaticality score measures how well the AI tool\u2019s responses follow  the rules of grammar. The fluency score measures how natural and easy to read the AI  tool\u2019s responses are. The overall performance of the AI tool is good, with an average score  of 0.85. The accuracy score is particularly high, at 0.85. This means that the AI tool\u2019s  responses are generally accurate and match the ground truth. The relevance score is also  good, at 0.82. This means that the AI tool\u2019s responses are generally relevant to the query.  The coherence, grammaticality, and fluency scores are all slightly lower, at 0.78, 0.88, and  0.85, respectively. This means that the AI tool\u2019s responses could be improved in terms of  structure, grammar, and naturalness. However, overall, the AI tool is performing well and  is generating responses that are accurate, relevant, coherent, grammatical, and fluent.  Table 2.

Behavioral performance evaluation of AI Tool responses</div>\n# 7. Behavioral performance evaluation of AI Tool responses\nBehavioral analysis of AI tool responses plays a crucial role in understanding how these systems interact with users based on the types of queries they receive. The varying nature of user queries can elicit diverse responses, and observing these patterns is essential for refining AI models. For instance, simple informational queries often yield concise and accurate responses, showcasing the model\u2019s ability to provide factual information. However, as queries become more complex or ambiguous, AI tools may struggle to maintain coherence or generate plausible answers, indicating the need for improvements in context understanding and reasoning capabilities. Table.3 illustrates the AI Tool responses based on input types. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Table 3. ChatGPT Responses Based on Input Types</div>\nInput Type \nExample Input \nSample Response \nQuestion \n\"What is the capital of France?\" \n\"The capital of France is Paris.\" \nInstruction \n\"Please provide a step-by-step \nguide for baking a cake.\" \n\"Sure, here\u2019s a step-by-step \nguide to bake a cake...\" \nConversation Continu- \nation \nUser: \"How\u2019s the weather?\" \n\"The weather is quite pleasant \ntoday.\" \n \nAssistant: \"It\u2019s sunny with a \nslight breeze.\" \n \nPrompt \n\"Write a short story about a \nhaunted house.\" \n\"In a quiet village, stood an old, \nabandoned house...\" \nCommand \n\"Translate \u2019hello\u2019 to French.\" \n\"The translation of \u2019hello\u2019 in \nFrench is \u2019bonjour\u2019.\" \nClarification Request \n\"Can you provide more details \nabout your project?\" \n\"Sure, I\u2019d be happy to provide \nmore details...\" \nBehavioral analysis also involves assessing how AI systems handle emotionally  charged queries, where empathy and sensitivity are crucial. Ethical considerations come  into play when monitoring responses to potentially harmful queries, ensuring that the tool  does not propagate misinformation, violence, or discriminatory content. Through behav- \nioral analysis, developers can continuously fine-tune AI tools, enhance their performance and align them with user expectations while upholding ethical standards in the response provided. In the sub-sections we have analysed the performance of AI-tool on differen types of queries from used end. Table. 4 illustrates comparison among responses based on nature of the queries. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"> 4.

Conclusion\nThe overall response pattern of AI Tool can be characterized by its ability to generate  coherent and contextually relevant responses to a wide range of questions and prompts. It  leverages the vast amount of information it has been trained on to provide informative and  helpful answers. However, it\u2019s important to note that AI Tool\u2019s responses are generated  based on patterns it has learned from the training data, and it may occasionally produce  incorrect or nonsensical answers. The model does not possess real-world understanding  or true comprehension, so it can sometimes generate responses that may sound plausible  but are factually incorrect. Additionally, AI Tool\u2019s responses can be influenced by the  phrasing and context of the input it receives. Even slight variations in how a question is  asked can lead to different responses, and the model may not consistently provide the  same answer for synonymous queries. Furthermore, while AI Tool has been designed to  avoid generating explicit, offensive, or inappropriate content, it may not always perfectly  filter out such responses. Users should exercise caution and report any inappropriate  content encountered while using the system. Overall, AI Tool serves as a powerful tool  for generating human-like text and engaging in interactive conversations. However, it is  essential to use the model\u2019s responses critically, verify information independently when  necessary, and understand its limitations as an AI language model. \n# Declaration\n\u2022  There is no conflicts of interest.  \u2022  No financial support has been received from any agency for the proposed work. \n# References \n",
