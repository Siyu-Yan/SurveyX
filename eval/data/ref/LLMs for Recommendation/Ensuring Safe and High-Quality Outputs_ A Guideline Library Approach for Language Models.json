Considerable efforts\n\u2217Corresponding autor. chenlin@xmu.edu.cn 1Code can be found at https://github.com/XMUDM/ Guide-Align\nare being made to implement safeguards for LLMs, ensuring their outputs align with human values. Yao et al. (2023) categorize prevalent alignment techniques into three distinct approaches. The first category, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), improves LLMs\u2019 task-solving abilities and adherence to user instructions through instruction data augmentation (Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). The second category involves training LLMs using implicit human feedback or comparison signals on pairs of model behaviors, enabling the models to learn human preferences and generate responses accordingly (OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022). The third category integrates LLMs with predefined principles that reflect societal values (Bai et al., 2022b; Solaiman and Dennison, 2021; Sun et al., 2023b; Glaese et al., 2022). One of the most widespread criteria for alignment is \u2019HHH\u2019, which expects LLMs to be helpful, honest, and harmless (Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022). Practical applications may involve a synergistic combination of these three types of techniques to optimize the alignment of the model with human values. Nevertheless, the literature reveals two issues with current research efforts:\n# Limitations of Manually Written Rules\neral studies (Sun et al., 2023b; Glaese et al., 2022; Solaiman and Dennison, 2021; Bai et al., 2022b) have used manually crafted rules to align model outputs with human values. Despite some success, these rules have significant limitations: a. Limited Matching Precision: These rules are typically formulated to prioritize generality over specificity to balance applicability and labor costs. Consequently, they offer less precise guidance than those tailored for nuanced, fine-grained matching. b. Limited Comprehensiveness: Predicting all potential deployment scenarios is challenging, making it hard to create rules that effectively cover\ndiverse situations. Moreover, inappropriate rules can introduce noise and unintended side effects, undermining the model\u2019s performance.\nInsufficient Risk Perception Models without safety training often lack risk perception, making them ineffective at identifying insecure information within a context. As a result, they are more likely to generate insecure outputs from diverse inputs. Current research approaches, whether they involve prompting AI for self-critique and revision(Bai et al., 2022b) or enabling the model to select and adhere to rules(Sun et al., 2023b), rely on a basic level of security risk awareness of the model. However, models without safety training face challenges in performing these tasks autonomously, particularly without external aids like in-context learning examples.\nTo address the above issues, we propose a novel method called Guide-Align. This approach autonomously generates a comprehensive library of detailed guidelines tailored to diverse inputs. We also train a retrieval model to associate inputs with relevant guidelines. These resources are then used to guide LLMs during response generation, ensuring safe and high-quality outputs, thereby aligning with human values. As an optional step, we apply our method to open-source input data, creating an alignment dataset. This dataset is used to fine-tune a large model, which we call Labrador. We foster a more fine-grained match between inputs and guidelines by tailoring specific guidelines for each input. Additionally, we enhance the comprehensiveness of the guideline repository by introducing diversity in inputs while constructing the guideline library. These dual strategies enable our method to overcome limitations associated with manually written rules. Furthermore, we address the safety awareness deficit in the model lacking safety training by integrating the security expertise derived from a more robust, safety-trained LLM through a lightweight retrieval model. In summary, our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We introduce a novel method named GuideAlign for aligning models with human values.\n\u2022 We provide a plug-and-play component with a comprehensive and detailed guideline library and a corresponding retrieval model. This\ncomponent markedly augments the security and quality of LLMs.\n We construct an alignment dataset to provide a valuable resource to facilitate the alignment of models with human values. Furthermore, we utilize this dataset to train a model named Labrador. Despite a parameter scale of 13 billion, Labrador exhibits performance that surpasses GPT-3.5-turbo and exceeds the alignment capabilities of GPT-4 on three benchmarks.\n# 2 Our Method: Guide-Align\nThe Guide-Align framework encompasses two phases: Guideline Library Construction and Retrieval Model Training, followed by Inference. Additionally, we introduce Fine-tuning as an optional phase. The framework of Guide-Align is shown as Figure 1, and we describe each step in detail.\n# 2.1 Guideline Library Construction and Retrieval Model Training\nIn this phase, a safety-trained LLM meticulously analyzes the input data from the training set, determining whether it contains unsafe content or has the potential to prompt AI assistants to generate insecure or inappropriate responses. This step aims to enable the safety-trained LLM to develop targeted rules for safety-relevant input data. In the event of an affirmative determination by the model (indicated by the term \"yes\" in the response), the model, contextualizing the safety detection step, is then instructed to formulate guidelines. These guidelines serve to direct AI assistants, ensuring the safety of their responses when confronted with such inputs. Conversely, if the model determines that the input is devoid of insecure content (i.e., indicated by the term \"no\" in the response), the model is instructed to generate guidelines to enhance the overall quality of AI assistants\u2019 responses when presented with such inputs, without considering the context generated by the safety detection step. An illustrative example of a safetyrelated input and its corresponding set of guidelines is presented in Figure 2. Let I = {i1, i2, . . . , in} denote the set of inputs, where n represents the size of the training set. For each ij \u2208I (j = 1, 2, ..., n), a corresponding set of guidelines Gj = {gj,1, gj,2, . . . , gj,kj} is derived, where kj denotes the number of guidelines generated for the jth input. Typically, the guideline\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/76ae/76ae0449-630e-4da4-ac4e-718348e15e32.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(1) Guideline Library Construction and  Retrieval Model Training</div>\nFigure 1: Framework of Guide-Align. (1) Guideline Library Construction and Retrieval Model Training (\u2212\u2192) : Using a safety-trained model (GPT-3.5-turbo in our paper), we discern the safety of input data within the training dataset and generate corresponding guidelines. Subsequently, we create a guideline library and train an input-guideline retrieval model. (2) Inference (\u2212\u2192) : For a new input, the retrieval model retrieves the top N relevant guidelines. These guidelines are then deduplicated based on similarity to obtain k (k<=N) guidelines. They are combined with the initial input for LLM to produce secure, high-quality responses. Fine-tuning (Optional)(\u2212\u2192) : Using an open-source dataset, we follow the inference process for inputs, generate corresponding outputs, join them with initial inputs to create an alignment dataset, and use it to fine-tune the base model, referred as Labrador.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/f3c3/f3c39bcb-860d-4db6-a3af-b26b48325a1d.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 2: An example of a safety-related input and its corresponding guidelines.\ngeneration process, guided by few-shot exemplars, yields kj values within the range of 5 to 7. The compiled guideline library (GL) encompass all guides associated with the inputs, forming GL = \ufffdn j=1 Gj. Furthermore, inputguideline pairs are established by pairing each input with its corresponding guidelines. For example, for ij and its associated guidelines set Gj = {gj,1, gj,2, . . . , gj,kj}, kj input-guideline pairs are\n# generation process, guided by few-shot exemplars, yields kj values within the range of 5 to 7.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(2) Inference</div>\nobtained: (ij, gj,1), (ij, gj,2), . . . , (ij, gj,kj). All resulting input-guideline pairs contribute to the training of a retrieval model designed to match inputs with their associated guides, denoted as g = retrieval_model(i).\nConsequently, the integration of the guideline library and the retrieval model constitutes a plugand-play component that facilitates the generation stage of LLMs.\nThe focal point of our efforts lies in ensuring the safety of the response generated by LLMs. Simultaneously, we aim to maintain or even enhance the model\u2019s performance in addressing questions unrelated to security. Therefore, our training dataset is curated to encompass both safety-related data and a diverse set of data unrelated to safety. For safety-related inputs, we generated input data containing 8 types of insecure types and 6 types of command attacks using the construction method proposed by Sun et al. (2023a). As for securityindependent inputs, we utilized Alpaca\u2019s training instruction dataset. Detailed statistical information regarding the training set and the guideline library is expounded upon in Section 3.2.\nDuring the inference stage, the trained retrieval model extracts relevant guidelines from the guideline library for each given input. Given that guidelines are tailored to specific inputs, an influx of input data may result in numerous similar guidelines within the library. To ensure precision in matching, we selectively clean nearly identical guidelines, refraining from stringent deduplication. As a result, the retrieved guidelines may still exhibit substantial similarity. Subsequently, we employ a process based on string fuzzy matching on the retrieved guideline set to impose a more stringent elimination of duplications. The resultant top-k guidelines, post-deduplication, are concatenated with the original input and presented to the LLM to generate safe and high-quality responses.\n# 2.3 Fine-tuning (Optional)\nFurthermore, we introduce an optional fine-tuning phase. Consistent with the workflow employed during the inference stage, we leverage instructions from an open-source dataset to generate wellaligned responses. However, there is a divergence from the inference stage: to enhance the quality of the generated dataset, we incorporate a small number of examples to assist the model in better adhering to the guidelines. Significantly, these examples are not utilized during the inference stage. The generated responses, in conjunction with the instructions, constitute our newly formed dataset. Subsequently, we utilize this dataset to fine-tune a base model, resulting in a refined model, termed Labrador, which is characterized by its alignment with human values.\n# 3 Experiment\n# 3.1 Experiment Setup\nDuring the construction of the guideline library, a temperature value of 0.7 is applied to the safetytrained model (referred to as GPT-3.5-turbo in our paper). Throughout the inference and fine-tuning stages, LLMs are decoded with a temperature of 0 to minimize the randomness. We initially retrieve 20 guidelines for each input, and subsequently sample the top 6 after removing duplicates. The deduplication threshold is defined at 0.53. Further details regarding the experimental setup are provided in Section E.\n# 3.2 The Statistic Information of Training Set And Guideline Library\nDuring the construction of the guideline library and the training of the retrieval model, we formulate guidelines encompassing 52k security-independent questions drawn from Self-instruct (Wang et al., 2023a) and 100k security-related questions developed following the methodology proposed by Sun et al. (2023a). This aggregation yields a cumulative total of 767k guidelines, and detailed statistical information can be found in Table 1. Subsequently, both the questions and guidelines are utilized as the training, dev, and test set of the retrieval model. However, the guidelines underwent a deduplication process based on string fuzzy matching with a predetermined threshold of 0.75. Following this procedure, the de-duplicated guidelines are incorporated into the guideline repository, resulting in a final repository size of 33k.\nCategory\n# Q\n# G\nAlpaca\n51975\n272400\nSafety Scenarios\n71958\n350979\nInstruction Attack\n29480\n143828\nTotal\n153413\n767207\nTable 1: The number of questions and corresponding guidelines across different categories.\nTable 1: The number of questions and corresponding guidelines across different categories.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/8b34/8b3471a7-8171-42d6-a457-41f3d22d4575.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3: The questions in 8 typical safety scenarios (inner circle) and their top utilized guidelines (outer circle).

The figures exclusively illustrate the keywords segment of the guidelines.\nFigure 3 presents the questions in 8 typical safety\nscenarios and their top corresponding guidelines. It indicates that our approach tailors distinct guidelines for various types of inputs. For instance, the most frequent guideline for questions about crimes and illegal activities is \u2019Discourage Illegal Activities\u2019. More demonstrations of question categories and the corresponding guidelines are shown in Appendix A.\n# 3.3 Baselines and Labrador\nThe baseline models utilized in this study include: Vicuna (13b-v1.3)(Chiang et al., 2023), a model devoid of additional safety training; GPT-3.5turbo(OpenAI, 2022), a model subjected to SFT and RLHF; and GPT-4(OpenAI, 2023), a model that integrates more safety measures such as reinforcement learning with RBRMs (a collection of rule-based reward models). Labrador represents our well-aligned Language Model (LLM), developed during the fine-tuning phase of the Guide-Align process. Its foundational model is LLaMa-2-13b(Touvron et al., 2023). The training dataset instructions for Labrador are derived from data generated via the Self-Align method, as released by Sun et al. (2023b)2, encompassing approximately 28,000 instructions. The output generation adheres to the guidelines established by Vicuna, utilizing two-shot exemplars.\n# 3.4 Benchmarks and Results\n# 3.4 Benchmarks and Results 3.4.1 Do_Not_Answer\nDo_not_answer(Wang et al., 2023b) is an opensource dataset to evaluate LLMs\u2019 safety mechanism at a low cost. The dataset is curated and filtered to consist only of prompts to which responsible language models do not answer. It collects 939 instructions, the distribution across five risk areas and 12 harm types. The detailed information is shown in Table 6 of the Appendix. In this dataset, we generate responses using each baseline model under two conditions: with and without guidelines. Additionally, responses are also generated by Labrador. Subsequently, we employ a fine-tuned Longformer classifier3 to assess the potential harm present in the responses generated by the models. The results shown in Table 2 indicate that all models exhibit a significant improvement in perfor-\n2https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhiqings/ dromedary-2-70b-v2 3It is provided by the authors of the dataset and can be found at the following link: https://huggingface.co/ LibrAI/longformer-harmful-ro\nModel\nw/o\nw/\nGuidelines\nGuidelines\nVicuna\n94.4\n97.9 (+3.5)\nGPT-3.5-turbo\n98.5\n99.0 (+0.5)\nGPT-4\n97.6\n99.7 (+2.1)\nLabrador (Ours)\n98.1\n-\nTable 2: Proportion of harmless responses (%, higher is better).\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/5dd2/5dd224b5-013a-415f-b2f4-8624aa42716c.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4: Harmful response distribution across the five risk areas.

Specifically, Labrador even surpasses GPT-4 in the absence of guidelines, with an accuracy of 98.1%. This demonstrates that the new dataset we have created is well-aligned. Furthermore, we illustrate the distribution of harmful responses across various risk areas for each model, as shown in Figure 4. A substantial proportion of Vicuna\u2019s insecure responses fall within the first risk category, highlighting its less-thanoptimal performance in terms of privacy security. However, the integration of guidelines significantly mitigates this problem. Moreover, across risk areas II and III, adherence to guidelines consistently improves the performance of all LLMs, emphasizing the effectiveness of these guidelines in managing legal, ethical, fairness, and civilizational aspects. On the contrary, in risk area IV, Misinformation Harms, the impact of guidelines remains\nambiguous. Labrador, specifically, demonstrates the weakest performance within this area, generating eight insecure responses. This accentuates the necessity for further refinement in our methodology to tackle the models\u2019 hallucinations.\n# 3.4.2 HHH_Alignment\nHHH_Alignment(Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022) evaluates language models on alignment, pragmatically broken down into the categories of helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness, and other. The benchmark is designed to evaluate model alignment and capabilities without explicitly distinguishing between these facets. We have reframed the task in HHH_Alignment, treating it as a generative task to assess the model\u2019s performance in producing responses. The refined dataset, devoid of repeated questions, consists of 22 instances in the helpfulness category, 19 in the honesty category, 25 in the harmlessness category, and 37 in the other category. We conduct four sets of comparison experiments on HHH_Alignment. Two of these sets aimed to assess the performance of Vicuna and GPT-3.5-turbo with and without the guidelines. The remaining two sets involve the comparative analysis between Labrador and both Vicuna and GPT-3.5-turbo. We task GPT-4 with selecting the superior response from a pair of responses. To mitigate potential biases introduced by the order of options, we systematically reversed the option order, facilitating two evaluations for each question. Table 3 illustrates all four experimental sets\u2019 outcomes. In the first two experimental series, our observations indicate that adherence to guidelines yields improved results for both Vicuna and GPT-3.5turbo, surpassing the quality of the original outputs. Nevertheless, the impact of guidelines on these two models is not uniform across instruction types. Specifically, for Vicuna, the guidelines prove more beneficial for the Helpful category, with no discernible assistance for the Honest category. Conversely, GPT-3.5-turbo exhibits the opposite pattern. We posit that this inconsistency may be attributed to inherent dissimilarities in the models\u2019 capacities across different types of questions, as well as their divergent abilities to adhere to varied types of guidelines. This aspect will be subject to further investigation in our subsequent research endeavors. Additionally, the subsequent two sets of experimental results are noteworthy for distinctly demonstrating Labrador\u2019s consistent outperfor-\nCategory\nWin\nTie\nLose\nNet Win Rate\nVicuna(+G) vs. Vicuna\nHarmless\n26\n4\n20\n12.0%\nHelpful\n23\n9\n12\n25.0%\nHonest\n18\n1\n19\n-2.6%\nOther\n37\n8\n29\n10.8%\nOverall\n104\n22\n80\n11.7%\nGPT-3.5-turbo(+G) vs. GPT-3.5-turbo\nHarmless\n26\n4\n20\n12.0%\nHelpful\n19\n2\n23\n-9.1%\nHonest\n26\n0\n12\n36.8%\nOther\n35\n34\n5\n40.5%\nOverall\n106\n40\n60\n22.3%\nLabrador vs. Vicuna\nHarmless\n37\n1\n12\n50.0%\nHelpful\n26\n5\n13\n29.5%\nHonest\n22\n2\n14\n21.1%\nOther\n43\n5\n26\n23.0%\nOverall\n128\n13\n65\n30.6%\nCategory\nWin\nTie\nLose\nNet Win Rate\nVicuna(+G) vs. Vicuna\nHarmless\n26\n4\n20\n12.0%\nHelpful\n23\n9\n12\n25.0%\nHonest\n18\n1\n19\n-2.6%\nOther\n37\n8\n29\n10.8%\nOverall\n104\n22\n80\n11.7%\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Labrador vs. GPT-3.5-turbo</div>\nHarmless\n41\n5\n4\n74.0%\nHelpful\n26\n4\n14\n27.3%\nHonest\n32\n0\n6\n68.4%\nOther\n54\n4\n16\n51.4%\nOverall\n153\n13\n40\n54.9%\nTable 3: Comparison of responses generated by different methods and LLMs on HHH_Alignment.

This underscores Labrador\u2019s remarkable ability to align with human values.\n# 3.4.3 Vicuna_Benchmark\nVicuna Benchmark(Chiang et al., 2023) encompasses diverse question categories, including Fermi problems, roleplay scenarios, coding/mathematical tasks, etc., totaling 80 queries. Employing this benchmark, we assess the efficacy of our approach across a spectrum of tasks extending beyond security-related scenarios. Following the methodology articulated by Chiang et al. (2023), we employ GPT-4 to evaluate LLMs\u2019 responses based on criteria such as helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and level of detail. Moreover, we incorporate safety as an additional evaluative dimension. We performed the same four experiments on this dataset as on HHH_Alignment. The performance comparison is\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/e8cc/e8ccbf29-6d0c-45eb-9382-c89723727e6f.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\nFigure 5: Comparison of responses generated by different methods and LLMs on Vicuna_Benchmark.

In each experimental set, \"Win\", \"Tie\" and \"Lose\" refer to the outcomes on the left relative to the right of the \"vs.\".\nThe findings depicted in Figure 5 demonstrate a consistency with the outcomes observed for the \"Helpful\" category within HHH_Alignment. Specifically, guidelines exhibit greater efficacy for Vicuna compared to GPT-3.5-turbo, and notably, Labrador exhibits a more pronounced performance advantage over Vicuna than over GPT3.5-turbo. This consistency can be attributed to the nature of the Vicuna_benchmark, which comprises predominantly security-scenario-irrelevant queries, effectively functioning as an expanded \"Helpful\" dataset.\n# 3.5 Comparison with Self-Align\nTo contrast our approach with Self-Align\u2019s approach (Sun et al., 2023b), which involves manual formulation of 16 generic rules to guide a base LLM through in-context learning from rule application demonstrations, we conduct an experiment to compare the quality of datasets generated by both methods. Specifically, we randomly selected 1000 instances with identical questions from datasets generated by each method and employed GPT-4 to assess the relative efficacy of their respective responses. The results, illustrated in Figure 6, indicate that our dataset outperforms the one generated by Self-Align by 24.8%. This observation underscores the superior performance of our method, leveraging a retrieval model to match autonomously generated comprehensive and contextually relevant guidelines.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/b302/b302429e-9f36-48bc-b723-23cee506beda.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\nFigure 6: Comparison of the datasets generated with Guide-Align (ours) against Self-Align: assessed by GPT-4.

This involves examining the rules generated with and without integrating the safety detection phase for identical safety-relevant inputs.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/5688/5688ea77-b9d3-4613-83f8-80c3ba3c8d8f.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 7: An example of an safety-related input and its corresponding guidelines</div>\nFigure 7 depicts an input devoid of explicit unsafe content; however, it possesses the potential to prompt the AI assistant to generate unsafe or inappropriate responses. In the context of safety detection, GPT-3.5-turbo acknowledges the potential vulnerability of the AI assistant\u2019s generated responses to misuse. For example, individuals harboring malicious intent could manipulate the generated content for racial discrimination, particularly when the AI assistant is compiling a list of terms to be avoided. As a countermeasure, GPT-3.5-turbo has established the \"Monitor for Misuse\" protocol to address this concern. Guidelines that omit a safety detection phase fail to recognize the critical\nimportance of addressing this issue.\n# 3.6.2 Identifying Risks through Retrieval Model\n# 3.6.2 Identifying Risks through Retrieval\nWe conceptualize the guideline library, retrieval model, and LLM for generating responses as an integrated AI system. Our designed AI system encapsulates GPT-3.5-turbo\u2019s risk awareness by utilizing the retrieval model. It addresses the challenge posed by LLMs lacking safety training, which results in insufficient risk perception, hindering their ability to select appropriate rules autonomously. To verify the system\u2019s risk identification capabilities, we conduct a series of comparative experiments on the \"do_not_answer\" dataset. Specifically, we employ the retrieval model to retrieve guidelines for each input. Success is defined as the system correctly identifying safety-related guidelines within the top 3 retrieved. In contrast, we task the Vicuna with detecting the harmfulness of each input under both zero-shot and 5-shot conditions. The respective risk identification accuracies for the system, the Vicuna with zero-shot and with 5-shot are 94.7%, 39.0%, and 42.4%. Consequently, we infer that the retrieval model effectively aligns safety-related rules with unsafe inputs, thereby augmenting the overall system\u2019s risk awareness. Notably, this risk awareness remains consistent and unaffected by variations in the performance of LLMs.\n# 3.6.3 The Effect of Retrieved Guidelines\nTo quantitatively assess the effect of retrieved guidelines, we perform distinct experiments employing Vicuna on HHH_Alignment. Specifically, when faced with a new test input, we directly employ GPT-3.5-turbo to generate the appropriate guidelines for it and subsequently let Vicuna follow these rules to generate responses, which are compared with the responses generated under the retrieved guidelines. Figure 8 demonstrates a comparable influence between retrieved and directly generated guidelines. GPT-4 rates 93 responses generated with retrieved guidelines as superior, 92 as inferior, and 21 as equivalent. Distinct advantages of each guideline type emerge across various question categories: retrieved guidelines excel in the Helpful and Honest categories, while directly generated guidelines prove more effective for Harmless and Other questions. It is noteworthy that even within the Harmless and Other categories, the inclusion of retrieved guidelines exhibits efficacy compared to scenarios\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/d68c/d68ccc97-9ba1-4a17-8178-4f0509f924cd.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\nFigure 8: Comparison of Vicuna\u2019s responses with different guidelines on HHH_Alignment. Retrieved Guidelines vs. Generated Guidelines. \"Win\", \"Tie\" and \"Lose\" refer to the outcomes on the left relative to the right of the \"vs.\".\nwhere guidelines are not employed, as presented in Table 3. During the inference stage, due to the introduction of safety detection and guideline generation, the directly generated guidelines approach introduces significantly higher overhead and latency(approximately 26\u00d7) than the approach using retrieved guidelines. Obviously, our method, offline building of the guideline library and retrieving guidelines during the inference phase, offers greater advantages. Furthermore, we present additional exemplars of generated responses, following diverse guidelines, in Appendix B.\n# 4 Related Work\nWhen aligning through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), models are trained with human-valued data (Solaiman and Dennison, 2021). Various strategies, such as Constitutional-AI(Bai et al., 2022b) and Self-Align (Sun et al., 2023b), are designed to employ LLMs to generate instruction data for alignment. Despite its benefits, SFT struggles with generalization and lacks negative feedback. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been introduced to overcome these issues, which uses a reward model trained on model-generated responses (OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). However, RLHF is costly, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters. An alternative approach is incorporating alignment goals into prompts without modifying the model structure or parameters. Bai et al. (2022b) instructs the model to criticize and revise its non-\ncompliant responses through prompts, aiming for a final safe response. Similarly, Sun et al. (2023b) formulates 16 generic rules, which are adaptively added to prompts and mandated for adherence by the model. However, manually written rules suffer from limited precision and comprehensiveness, and LLMs\u2019 self-critique or automatic match rules necessitate risk awareness, which depends on the base model\u2019s performance. Our approach addresses these limitations by automatically generating a comprehensive and detailed guideline library using a safety-trained model. In addition, RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG)(Lewis et al., 2020) has proven efficacy in mitigating issues such as model hallucinations(Gao et al., 2023) and knowledge staleness through knowledge retrieval. In contrast, we employ a trained retrieval model for guideline matching, ensuring the safety of the responses and stability irrespective of the base model\u2019s performance.\n# 5 Conclusion\nWe propose Guide-Align, a guideline-oriented method to augment the safety and quality of LLMs. We construct a comprehensive and detailed guideline library complemented by a retrieval model that matches inputs with appropriate guidelines. These elements constitute a plug-and-play module that enables various LLMs to achieve alignment with minimal expenditure. Experiments conducted across diverse datasets consistently illustrate that our methodology bolsters model safety while preserving or even enhancing performance in other dimensions. Furthermore, we curate an alignment dataset and employ it to fine-tune a secure and dependable model, denoted as Labrador.\n# Acknowledgements\nChen Lin is the corresponding author and is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No.62372390).\n# Limitations\nHere, we discuss two limitations of our method:\nRelying on a Safety-Trained LLM Our approach necessitates reliance on a robust, safetytrained LLM in the initial phase to generate guidelines. Consequently, the quality of the guidelines is contingent upon this model\u2019s capabilities. Furthermore, a diverse range of inputs is employed\nto ensure the comprehensiveness of guidelines, albeit with associated cost implications. Therefore, despite the desirability of using GPT-4, we have chosen to employ GPT-3.5-turbo.\nConstrained Cross-Linguistic Applicability Our methodology involves employing a single language retrieval model for extracting guidelines from a library. However, considering that the input may likely encompass multiple languages, we recognize the necessity to establish a multilingual guidelines library and train a cross-language retrieval model in the future.\n# Broader Impact\nOur research endeavors to enhance the safety and practicality of models without compromising their performance. Simultaneously, we aspire to encourage researchers to delve into the alignment of values concerning LLMs. The alignment dataset and model we publish serve as a valuable resource, fostering broader engagement within the research community and empowering researchers to explore and advance the field of value alignment. However, it is crucial to acknowledge and mitigate potential negative impacts associated with our work. A notable concern is the risk of misuse, wherein, under the worst-case scenario, this guide-based alignment approach could be altered to a poisoning method based on malicious guidance. This emphasizes the need for sustained vigilance and ethical oversight throughout the development and deployment of AI technologies. Furthermore, the openness of the guideline library and alignment datasets introduces the possibility of reinforcing biases. Unforeseen biases within the open-source guideline library or alignment datasets could inadvertently perpetuate unintended biases in AI systems. The presence of biased information in these resources poses a significant ethical challenge and underscores the necessity for continuous scrutiny, transparency, and efforts to mitigate unintended consequences.\n# References\nSahar Abdelnabi, Kai Greshake, Shailesh Mishra, Christoph Endres, Thorsten Holz, and Mario Fritz. 2023.

CoRR, abs/2309.07045.\n# A Question Categories And Corresponding Guidelines\nFigure 9 presents a detailed statistic of the questions types and their corresponding guidelines of part of our training set. It indicates that safetyrelated questions tend to align more with safetyrelated guidelines. Interestingly, even within the Alpaca training set, there is a noticeable alignment with some safety-related guidelines, such as \u2019Avoidance of Bias\u2019. These observations underscore the robustness of our methodology in enhancing the security of the model.\n# B The Effect of Different Guidelines\nIn Table 4, we illustrate the varying effects of guidelines at different granularity levels on guiding the model in generating responses. The coarse-grained guidelines are taken from (Sun et al., 2023b), and the fine-grained guidelines are generated by GuideAlign. The brown segments in the table correspond to the red segments of the guidelines, indicating that the model produces more targeted replies when guided by finer-grained instructions. In Figure 5, we illustrate the model\u2019s responses under three distinct conditions: absence of guidance, presence of inappropriate guidance, and presence of appropriate guidance. In the absence of guidance, the model adopts a secure behavior by refusing to provide a response. However, in the presence of inappropriate guidance, the model may produce insecure outputs as it adheres to the provided guidelines.\n# C The Five Risk Areas In Do_Not_Answer\nThe stastic information of do_not_answer is demonstrated in Table 6, where we can obtain the harm types and the number of corresponding questions.\n# D Additional Related Work\nRedTeaming Data To enhance model security, Bai et al. (2022a); Ganguli et al. (2022) employed manual red-team testing, wherein red-team members craft potentially risky inputs to elicit insecure behavior in their models. Despite its effectiveness, the manual creation of malicious prompts and corresponding answers necessitates substantial labor and time investments. Consequently, an increasingly favored approach today involves the automated generation of red-team data, characterized\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/2667/266729bb-d173-405a-a04f-dc78a76880d0.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(a) The questions in 6 instruction attack types (inner circle) and their top utilized guidelines (outer circle).</div>\nFigure 9: Statistic of our training datasets. The figures exclusively illustrate the keywords segment of the guidelines\nby two primary methodologies: prompt injection and adversarial model training. In the former, existing prompts transform jailbreak prompts(Yu et al., 2023; Perez and Ribeiro, 2022; Abdelnabi et al., 2023), while the latter involves training an adversarial model to produce new malicious inputs continually. For instance, Ge et al. (2023) employed a pre-curated seed dataset of over 2,400 instances to train an adversarial model. This involved supplying a malicious prompt as input and obtaining a prompt of the same violation category or attack style as output. The resultant model was subsequently employed to target a given model, with iterative refinements based on prompts from successful attacks. In our work, we refer to the approach of (Sun et al., 2023a) to augment our security-related guidelines by instructing the model to generate red team data.\n# Evaluation of Alignment\nEvaluation of Alignment Currently, four primary approaches exist for assessing model alignment. First, benchmark datasets with labeled answers such as Big-bench(Srivastava et al., 2022), Truthful-QA(Lin et al., 2022), SafetyBench(Zhang et al., 2023), and do_not_answer(Wang et al., 2023b) are utilized. Evaluations encompass generative, discriminative, and multiple-choice tasks tailored to the respective benchmark categories. Second, the assessment may be conducted manually or by experts, involving a comparison between the output of the target model and a refer-\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">(b) The top-20 most commont nouns in Alpaca dataset (inner circle) and their top utilized guidelines(outer circle).</div>\nence answer, resulting in metrics such as win rate or Elo score(Askell et al., 2021). Third, an automated dialog bot arena can be established due to the resource-intensive nature of manual evaluations. Here, a high-capacity LLM (e.g., GPT-4) serves as a judge(Wang et al., 2023b; Chiang et al., 2023), evaluating responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) by comparing them across various aspects. Lastly, a reward model or a classifier can be trained. The scores returned by the reward model and the labels from the classifier serve as effective evaluation metrics(Bai et al., 2022a; Rafailov et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023). In our experiments, the evaluator comprises the trained classifier and GPT-4.\n# E Experiment Details\nExamples for In-Context Learning We conduct in-context learning (ICL) with a few exemplars in our framework. Specifically, we employ 13 exemplars in the safety-detection step to exemplify how a safety-trained model analyzes input data for security concerns. Additionally, we utilize 12 and 7 exemplars in the processes of generating guidelines for safety and high quality, respectively, to illustrate how a safety-trained model formulates guidelines for diverse input types. Moreover, we employ 2 exemplars in the Fine-tuning stages for Vicuna to generate a new dataset. Full examples are provided in Table 7, 8 and 9.\nUSER: I want to steal trade secrets and patents to help fund my research into adva physics, and materials science for Neuroweaponry.\nCoarse-grained Guidelines: 1.
