They are responsible for automated linguistic capabilities such as sentiment analysis, question answering, translation, text-to-speech, speech recognition and auto-completion. Compared to rulebased and statistical methods, they exhibit superior performance in many of these tasks [21]. As a consequence language models power a growing number of everyday digital services, from search (Google Search, Microsoft Bing) to smart assistants (Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri) and email auto-completion (Microsoft Outlook, Gmail). Such models utilise prior context to suggest likely successor terms in a language generation task. Generalised pre-trained models, such as the GPT class of models [20, 31, 36] developed by OpenAI 1, have been shown to excel at predictive tasks. The release of GPT2 models of increased size over the course of 2019 [31] brought transformer-based language models and their capabilities to greater media and public attention (e.g. [38]). As the size, performance, capabilities and applications of such models grow, so too have concerns about prediction bias [40, 26, 48] and its social impacts [11, 13]. \u2018Bias\u2019 itself has varied meanings in the machine learning literature, and as discussed further below, here we limit discussion to measurable, systemic (non-\n1https://openai.com/\nrandom) and undesired differences in model predictions produced by input changes to one or more markers of social categories. Although a subject of considerable research in NLP and deep learning fields, bias remains a trenchant model characteristic, proving difficult to mitigate. Even when trained on large corpora and when comprising more than a hundred billion parameters, causal models continue to exhibit gender [26], religion [48] and disability [41] bias.\nDespite acknowledging its importance [27, 34, 49], scholars have paid less attention to intersectional bias in language models [50]. One non-exclusive method for identifying intersectional bias involves detecting differences, through a metric such as sentiment or toxicity, between outputs involving multiple social category markers from outputs produced by any one of those markers alone. While the presence of differences in language models is unlikely to mirror precisely the diverse experiences of intersectional bias in social life, it is also unlikely that such differences exhibit obvious or consistent relationships (e.g. additive, multiplicative, single category maximum). As intersectionality theorists have suggested, prejudice does more than simply accumulate over each category of social difference or disadvantage. Rather the combination of categories can result both in different intensifications of negative bias and sentiment, and in qualitatively new forms of marginalization and stigmatization [1, 9]. Measurement does not therefore exhaust intersectional bias identification, but can support future mitigation ef-\nforts. In addition, similar to [41] we aim to extend analysis of single-category bias to less studied categories such as disability. In examining disability as a single category and intersectionality, we consider how bias can manifest differently across and within impairment groups, including what the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities [3] terms \u201cphysical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments\u201d.\n# 2 Related Work\nBias has been a long-standing concern in AI and NLP research [26]. Research on language models and data sets has begun to self-report against bias metrics [36, 37], and others have developed checklists for testing model fairness and accuracy [46, 43]. We discuss here examples of three types of work: (i) techniques for identifying bias; (ii) techniques for mitigating or addressing bias; and (iii) sociological research on the ways algorithmic bias may result in adverse social effects. Our own work contributes to intersectional aspects of (i) and (iii), and we also consider approaches from the literature that may address (ii).\nGender bias has been studied across language models involving word embeddings [10] and contextual embeddings [35], as well as in neural machine translation (NMT) [32] and other natural language processing systems [33]. Racial and religion-based bias is also increasingly studied in algorithmic systems [18], and in language models specifically [50, 48]. Word embeddings, based on word2vec [6] and GLoVE [7], establish, for each unique term found in a text corpus, a set of weights that confer a sense of proximity to adjacent terms. For semantically related terms, such as \u2018woman\u2019, \u2018man\u2019 and other gender labels, their vectors within a d-dimensional space are likely to be similar (as measured by cosine similarity or other metrics), and together form a subspace that describes that similarity and represents a governing concept such as \u2018gender\u2019 [10, 26]. Differences between that subspace and other model tokens, such as occupational terms, form the basis for identifying bias. Transformer-based languages models such as BERT [14], ELMO [19] and GPT [20, 31, 36] add positionaland sentence-level to word- or token-level embeddings. These enable decoders responsible for translation, auto-completion or other tasks to attend to the context in which words or tokens appear. Such contextual embeddings make bias detection via cosine similarity of individual tokens more challenging, though [50] shows one method for doing so. Other approaches generate sentences from pre-defined prompts or templates for analysis [35, 24, 48]. Following [10], [35, 24] then use gender-swapping and compare the embeddings of suggested generated terms with principal component analysis. The resulting one or two components\nidentify systematic bias in the association of occupation or other social roles with gender. [40, 48, 37] instead employ sentiment analysis to examine respectively, gendered, religious and racial bias. This provides less direct and systematic evaluation, but nonetheless generates a measure of bias encountered during language model use. Sentiment also provides a more generalisable measure for biases that may not relate to social roles such as occupation, but manifest in other forms. This is especially true for the kinds of bias we find below generated by label combinations that denote the intersection of multiple social categories.\n# Bias Mitigation\nMany approaches to mitigating or addressing bias have been proposed. Broadly, these can be distinguished as data-driven, model-driven or use-driven. Discussing gender bias, [33] suggest \u2018data augmentation\u2019, \u2018gender tagging\u2019 and \u2018bias fine tuning\u2019 as examples of datadriven approaches; removing subspaces (e.g. gender) or isolating category-specific information in word embeddings as examples of model-driven approaches; and constraining or censoring predictions as examples of use-driven approaches. Model design has increasingly sought to address bias using various data-driven approaches, either during training or via fine-tuning. Both GPT-2 and GPT3 [31, 36] use criteria such as Reddit popularity and weights to de-bias training data, while \u2018The Pile\u2019, developed in part to train GPT-NEO, has sought to incorporate a wider range of text [37]. As [37] also point out, careful curation of training data goes some way towards addressing at least more conspicuous bias. [51] suggests a mitigation approach based on (1) training a de-biased upstream model and then (2) fine-tuning a downstream model. Model-driven approaches treat the language model post-training. For models involving word embeddings, these embeddings can be inspected, and following a debiasing heuristic, modified directly. [10] for example conducts a component analysis to identify bias, and then manipulates embedding values, to either increase or decrease cosine values between category terms in accordance with the analysis. Such techniques appear more difficult to apply to transformer models with contextual embeddings. [35] for example examines both data augmentation and model neutralisation, and finds model neutralisation less effective. Use-driven approaches constrain or modify inputs. [48] shows for instance how inclusion of modifiers can produce radically different predictions for terms (like \u2018Muslim\u2019 in their study) showing strong negative bias in GPT-3. More generally, generalised pre-trained models make possible \u2018one-shot\u2019 or \u2018few-shot\u2019 training [36], padding inputs with a small number of prior examples, that can selectively condition predictions. Such approaches depend upon knowledge of what biases exist, so they may correct for them, and moreover may produce other unintended effects, such as less relevant and\nlower quality outputs. We suggest in our Discussion below there are prospects for using category-neutral predictions as few-shot examples for de-biasing categoryspecific predictions.\n# Social Consequences of Bias\nAs they become increasingly deployed, language models invariably produce social consequence. Sociological studies have pointed to ways in which algorithmic bias can amplify existing real-world racism and sexism [18, 25] and reproduce downstream effects of such prejudice with respect to employability, insurability and credit ratings [8, 12]. In the context of language models, [11] discuss specific risks of \u2018exclusion, overgeneralization, bias confirmation, topic overexposure and dual use\u2019. Even methods developed to prevent harm towards minority groups can exacerbate inequalities. [42] for example found intersectional bias in the Twitter datasets used to train algorithms that detect hate speech and abusive language on social media, noting higher rates of tagged tweets from those posted by African-American men. However, most research on algorithmic bias, including intersectional bias [50], remains focused on race and gender categories. While disability scholars have long studied issues concerning technology bias, and have recently discussed some of the specific equity and fairness concerns arising from design and use of AI (e.g. [34, 22, 27, 30]), less attention has been paid to language model bias towards disability, as well as to sexuality, non-binary genders and other minority social categories. An exception is [41], which measures toxicity as well as sentiment in BERT model predictions. [52] have also explored using a BERT encoder to identify and correct ableist language use. Our study differs from these works in two ways: (1) it examines GPT rather than BERT models and (2) it also explores intersectional effects which, as [15, 49] note, are both significant and understudied. As sociologists have noted (e.g. [1]), combinations of gender, race, religion, disability and other characteristics lead to specific and underacknowledged disadvantage. In white settler colonial societies that include the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, such disadvantage occurs both in general social relations and in the context of dealing with governmental institutions: courts, prisons, hospitals, immigration detention centres and psychiatric clinics [9]. As these institutions come to depend on automation for tasks such as claims processing, records management and customer service, latent language model bias risks perpetuating ongoing injustices and discrimination. In response to these concerns, scholars as well as companies such as Microsoft2 and Google3 have developed fairness principles and practices for AI development and deployment [43]. Though welcome, such principles have not eradicated bias even from recently developed models. While size, model architecture and 2https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/ai/responsible-ai\n2https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/ai/responsible-ai 3https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/\ntraining set diversity appears to have some effect in reducing both single category and intersectional bias (e.g. [50]), the complexity of transformer systems also makes identification and redress challenging. This is especially true for intersectional bias, due to the many forms expressions of social categories can take: from gendered pronouns, person-first versus identity-first disability ascriptions and subcultural argot and slang that designate intersectional groups, to the role context plays in interpreting the sentiment valence of figurative expressions [44]. Further, intersectional expressions combine multiple and overlapping categories that correspond to complex real-world social marginalization and exclusion which change over time and space, and which manifest differently in discursive form as a result. Consequently intersectional bias may often not hold an obvious relation to bias of individual terms. However the attribution of single categories to overall biased outputs may help to diagnose which intersections matter most, and which consequently need to be addressed through mitigation techniques. The aim in this paper is to explore one set of combinations with respect to intersectional bias, and to determine whether any such instances of bias can be attributable to single, and more addressable, category labels.\n# 3 Method\nTo test for intersectional bias, we choose a combination of three categories: gender, religion and disability. Gender bias has been widely studied, and its inclusion here allows for comparison with prior work. Religion and disability bias has received some attention [48, 41], but not in relation to the same language models, nor as intersectional categories. All three categories have relatively unambiguous category markers, though some common identity-first disability qualifiers, such as \u2018disabled\u2019, \u2018deaf\u2019 and \u2018blind\u2019, are frequently, and often contentiously, used in contexts outside of social identity categories. For example, \u2018disabled\u2019 has often been used in technical literature to mean turned or switched off. While a feature of transformer models has been their ability to disambiguate homophones (such as varied meanings of \u2018like\u2019), performance on metaphoric or analogic modifiers varies. Our selection of terms is based on what is generally considered common use, as discussed further in relation to each of the three categories below. This aims to mirror commonality of these terms in the language models themselves, which are weighted towards media and social media text samples, rather than academic, advocacy or other literature. We note that this approach means, on the one hand, that norms and preferences around terminology and identity of particular disability groups may not always be reflected in selection of terms and, on the other, more extreme examples of biased language use may also not be generated and\nidentified. We select five categories of religion, following the World Religion Paradigm [4]. Though this paradigm is challenged in the literature, it likely reflects common religious terms of use in language model training sets. We add \u2018atheism\u2019 as a marker of explicit non-religious orientation, and an empty string (\u2018\u2019) as a null marker. With studies of coreference bias [21, 23], grammatical and social categories necessarily align, and gender is treated as binary- or ternary-valued. For autocompletion tasks, this constraint can be relaxed. We add \u2018transgender person\u2019 to \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019, and include \u2018person\u2019 as an un-gendered marker. Disability terms come in various forms, with the two most commonly accepted versions being peoplefirst and identity-first. Terms chosen for this analysis are not exhaustive, and also not universally accepted within the disability community. As with gender and religious categories, term selection does not imply endorsement, but rather represents a compromise between contemporary linguistic norms and likely term frequency within language model data sets, which reflect historical use. We follow [17] in determining which form is preferred, since these recent journalistic recommendations represent a reasonable balance between scientific and colloquial language use, and are also informed by disability community advocacy. We select two kinds of disability from five major categories of sensory, physical, neurodivergent, cognitive and psycho-social disability.\n\u2022 Sensory: blind, deaf \u2022 Physical: with quadriplegia, who uses a wheelchair \u2022 Neurodiverse: autistic \u2022 Cognitive: with Down Syndrome \u2022 Psycho-social: with OCD, with schizophrenia\nWe also include \u2018disabled\u2019 as a general marker of disability, and an empty string (\u2018\u2019) to signify a null marker. Each category is used to generate part of a prompt of the following form:\n# \u2018A/An\u2019 T Disability pre T Religion T Gender T Disability post Examples include:\n# Examples include:\nExamples include:\n\u2018An autistic Muslim man\u2019 \u2018An atheist woman with OCD\u2019\nPrompts constructed from combinations of terms (7 religion * 4 gender * 10 disability markers = 280 combinations) are used to generate samples of 100 sentences from publicly available causal language models. Following [40, 37, 48], we apply sentiment analysis to the generated sentences. During initial testing, we examined a total of five sentiment analysis metrics to classify sentences. First, we applied the default sentiment analyser supplied by the HuggingFace transformer library, DistilBERT base uncased finetuned SST-2, a lightweight but high quality [47] binary\nclassifier derived from BERT [29]. We have not modified the classifier\u2019s configuration from the defaults. The softmax activation means sentences are coarsely classified, producing confounds (e.g. \u2018neutral\u2019 sentences that are classified as highly negative). To counteract this, we also tested NLTK\u2019s sentiment classifier [2], which is more discriminatory but human review determined to be less accurate. We also analyse generated sentences with and without the prompt itself, since sentiment analysers may introduce bias of their own. We take the softmax scores in the range (0, 1), since these reduce the divergence from central values. Finally, we applied a sigmoid rather than softmax activation to sentiment logit scores. This metric appeared higher quality than NLTK, and offers more discrimination compared with softmax values (it is less likely to produce values that converge to 0 or 1). Softmax results are reported, since they are consistent with common classifier use, but sigmoid results have also been checked for consistency. We apply tests to two publicly available transformer model families designed for auto-completion: four GPT-2 models (124M, 355M, 774M and 1.5B) models; and four GPT-NEO models (125M, 350M, 1.3B and 2.7B) released in March and April 2021, an open source implementation of the GPT-3 architecture. This produces eight models in total. GPT-NEO is trained on \u2018The Pile\u2019 [37], which has been designed and evaluated in part to address gender and religious bias. Sentences are generated from zero-shot unconditional prompts through the Huggingface interface to both models, using parameters suggested by [45]: 50 tokens; top-k sampling [16], to limit next-word distribution to a defined number of words, also set to 50; and top-p nucleus sampling [39], set to 0.95, to sample only words that contribute to that probability distribution. These parameters are likely to be used in many realworld text generation settings, e.g. for story-telling or chatbots, and are for that reason adopted here. We define bias and its converse, fairness, as the difference or similarity between sentiment scores for prompts that are distinguished by categories of gender, religion, disability or other markers of social distinction. Following [5, 40], in order to be considered fair or unbiased, a prompt containing a description of an individual specified by any one or more of these markers should produce a sentence with, on average, the same sentiment score as any other prompt containing different, or absent, markers from the same category sets. As with [40], \u2018demographic parity\u2019 is met under the following conditions. For any category such as gender, a set of values is defined, e.g. A = {Male, Female, Transgender, Unspecified}, and A = a denotes a random variable with a value of a \u2208A. Again following [40], another value \u02dca is chosen from A \\ a. A sentiment classifier, fs, produces outputs in the interval (0, 1), and a language model, LM, generates sentences LM(x) and LM(\u02dcx), where x and \u02dcx are prompts containing a and \u02dca respectively. Ps(x) and Ps(\u02dcx) represent distributions of fs(LM(x)) and fs(LM(\u02dcx)); parity is met when these\ndistributions are equivalent, given a margin of error, \u03f5. Intersectional bias is defined in the same way, but for up to three variables, A = a, B = b and C = c, where a, b and c belong to sets of gender, disability and religious categories, and each is included in prompt x. Disparity, or bias, occurs when the distribution differences exceed \u03f5. We utilise simplified measures of bias, where \u03f5 values are derived via standard tests of distribution difference, ANOVA and t-tests. In particular, if t-test comparing distributions Ps(x) and Ps(\u02dcx) produces a large enough t-value < .0 (p < .001), then LM is negatively biased towards x. In addition, we use exploratory topic modelling and regression to examine what semantic associations and category variables contribute to bias. We also explore several prompt variations, including few-shot cases. We test for four hypotheses:\n# 4 Results\nShown in Table 1, overall mean scores indicate comparable sentiment across all models, with GPT-NEO 2.7B being most positive.

This suggests that to a large degree, intersectional language model\nbias can be inferred from the single categories from which they are derived.\n# Intersectional comparisons\nTo test intersectional bias, each full combination of three categories was compared with results for each category, and separately with each category and pairs of categories. All comparisons were conducted with t-tests. Of 252 distinct prompts, 19 or 8.8 per cent had lower average sentiment than each of the single categories considered in isolation. Only 2, or .9 per cent, had higher average sentiment scores. When compared\nwith all individual and paired categories, 2 or .9 per cent had lower average sentiment scores, and none had higher. Appendix A shows the 19 prompts. Again, these reflect the overall category results \u2013 gender specificity, identify-first disability, and Muslim, Hindu and, to a lesser degree, Christian religious categories all contribute to lower scores. These results point to the multiplying effect of intersectional categories, which also counteract the technical effect of prompt length noted above. Only two intersectional prompts score statistically higher than the individual categories from which they are composed: \u2018An Atheist person with Down Syndrome\u2019 and \u2018An Atheist transgender person with Down Syndrome\u2019. These results point to, conversely, the occasional positive effect of combining categories, if those categories already score higher than average. When three category prompt scores were compared against both individual and pairs of categories, no prompts scored higher while two scored lower: \u2018A blind Hindu woman\u2019 and \u2018A deaf Hindu woman\u2019. Such cases are rare (less than 1%), yet, since they are not readily predicted, important to acknowledge. In these two cases, moreover, their relative ranks decline with increased model and training set size, and their scores also decline in absolute terms with increased model size. Finally, when pairs of terms are compared with individual terms, five combinations (8.3 per cent, listed below) performed statistically worse than individual terms, and none better. Again all category combinations reinforce earlier results, with individual categories that score poorly contributing to worse performance for intersectional categories. These combinations are:\n\u2022 \u2018A Hindu man\u2019 \u2022 \u2018A Muslim man\u2019 \u2022 \u2018A Muslim woman\u2019 \u2022 \u2018A disabled man\u2019 \u2022 \u2018An autistic woman\u2019\n# Size, Diversity and Other Factors\nTo test for model size and type, we examined the best and worst terms for each of the three categories, subtracted empty category scores for those categories, and conducted t-tests comparing small (under 500M) with large and GPT-2 with GPT-NEO models. Table 5 summarises t and p values; for clarity, we modify signs to indicate whether difference magnitudes are increasing or decreasing, relative to null marker scores.\nModel Size\nModel Type\nt\np-value\nt\np-value\nGender\n\u2018transgender person\u2019\n5.78\n< .001\n16.44\n< .001\n\u2018man\u2019\n5.91\n< .001\n-6.80\n< .001\nDisability\n\u2018with Down Syndrome\u2019\n7.05\n< .001\n-7.99\n< .001\n\u2018disabled\u2019\n0.24\n0.81\n1.66\n0.10\nReligion\n\u2018Buddhist\u2019\n5.60\n< .001\n-5.67\n< .001\n\u2018Muslim\u2019\n-0.80\n0.42\n12.04\n< .001\nTABLE 5: Difference between null marker and high and low categories\nIn all cases but \u2018disabled\u2019 and \u2018Muslim\u2019, larger model size increases differences between the categories at statistically significant levels; for those two categories, change is not significant. GPT-NEO reduces differences between \u2018person\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019, but increases difference dramatically between \u2018person\u2019 and \u2018transgender person\u2019. Similarly, differences between positive disability and religious categories (\u2018with Down Syndrome\u2019, \u2018Buddhist\u2019) are reduced, while differences between negative categories (\u2018disabled\u2019, \u2018Muslim\u2019) increase. In aggregate, as shown in Table 1, GPT-NEO average scores are higher than GPT-2 (for all scores, .30 > .26), and larger models, with some individual group variances, score better than smaller ones (.29 > .27). T-tests confirm both results: GPT-NEO models produce more positive scores (t(223,998)=-25.82; p < .001); as do larger models (t(223,998)=-14.87; p < .001). While GPT-NEO differs from GPT-2 in other respects, the most salient difference is the size, variety and weighting of training data. Together these results suggest model size and training set diversity have at best mixed results in terms of bias reduction. Prompt length, number of terms and generated sentence length also plays a confounding role. Prompt string length (.07, p < .001) and number of terms (.02, p < .001) both correlate positively, though weakly, with positive sentiment. Generated sentence lengths (-.23, p < .001), conversely, correlate negatively with sentiment. Surprisingly, prompt length and number of terms also correlate negatively with sentence length. This technical artefact may be one factor as to why certain categories (\u2018transgender person\u2019, \u2018with Down Syndrome\u2019) produce more positively skewed sentences than others (\u2018man\u2019, \u2018blind\u2019). We consider these implications, and several further tests, in the discussion below.\n# Topic Modelling\nTo explore what terms language models are associating with prompts to produce negative or positively weighted sentiment scores, we generated topic models for sentences generated from worst and best scoring prompts. Generated with the Python gensim package, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model was trained on 15 passes, and asked to produce five topics. Generated sentences were split into words, stop words and\nother words with 4 characters or fewer were removed, and remaining words were lemmatised and stemmed. We modelled topics for worst and best scoring three category intersectional prompts (\u2018A blind Muslim man\u2019 and \u2018A Buddhist person with Down Syndrome\u2019). We included a further approximately mid-ranked prompt, \u2018A Jewish woman with quadriplegia\u2019, containing none of the categories featuring in the worst and best scoring prompts. Appendix C illustrates prominent resulting terms.\nTopic\nTop 10 most probable words\nTopic 1\nstate, killed, wearing, attacked, saudi,\npeople, islamic, attack, united, accused\nTopic 2\npolice, mosque, attack, arrested, allegedly,\ncalled, london, beaten, court, accused\nTopic 3\npolice, killed, officer, tried, attack, child,\nthree, street, mosque, attacked\nTopic 4\ndeath, police, found, arrested, sentenced,\nstabbed, allegedly, islamic, british, asked\nTopic 5\narrested, year, sentenced, first, islam,\nmosque, prison, white, trying, accused\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">TABLE 6: Prompt: \u2018A blind Muslim man\u2019</div>\nFor the lowest scoring prompt, Table 6 shows topics invariably dealing with violence, criminality and terrorism, with little variation. Topic 1 contains references to Islam, state and Saudi (Arabia), in connection with killing and attacks. Topics 2 and 4 refer to \u2018police\u2019, \u2018allegedly\u2019 and \u2018arrested\u2019 in the context of violence, while Topics 3 and 5 suggest connections between violence and religious buildings such as \u2018mosque\u2019.\nTopic\nTop 10 most probable words\nTopic 1\nfound, cancer, hospital, walk, condition,\nspinal, israel, husband, father, israeli\nTopic 2\nhospital, university, jewish, killed, group,\ntreated, mother, lived, people, severe\nTopic 3\nfamily, treatment, disability, husband, right,\ndoctor, condition, treated, diagnosed, cancer\nTopic 4\ndisease, accident, year, heart, death,\nmonth, unable, police, medical, condition\nTopic 5\nhospital, israel, husband, israeli, found,\nsurgery, cancer, brain, jerusalem, doctor\nTABLE 7: Prompt: \u2018A Jewish woman with quadriplegia\u2019\nTABLE 7: Prompt: \u2018A Jewish woman with quadriplegia\u2019\nFor the second mid-scoring prompt, Table 7 features mostly medical topics, with the exception of Topic 2, which includes a reference to violence (\u2018killing\u2019). Topics 1, 2 and 5 reference related geographic locations (Israel and Jerusalem), while topics 3 and 5 include more references to illness, surgery and male partners.\nTopic\nTop 10 most probable words\nTopic 1\nchild, buddha, syndrome, diagnosed, experience,\nquestion, unable, depression, meditation, people\nTopic 2\npeople, adult, religious, treated, year,\nthink, belief, given, family, problem\nTopic 3\nbuddhist, mother, could, buddha, unable,\nchild, would, friend, mental, condition\nTopic 4\ndisability, would, teaching, problem, world,\nmember, parent, living, autism, buddhism\nTopic 5\ndisability, people, different, normal, always,\nworld, often, experience, difficult, likely\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">TABLE 8: Prompt: \u2018A Buddhist person with Down Syndrome\u2019</div>\nFor the best-scoring prompt, Table 8 includes a greater number of religious and spiritual allusions, and while mentioning \u2018disability\u2019 twice and other terms related to psychosocial disability, contains little reference to clinical or medical settings. Topics 2 and 4 include terms related to both family and philosophy, while Topic 5 includes terms associated with living with disability (\u2018normal\u2019, \u2018different\u2019, \u2018experience\u2019). Together these results point to very different sets of topical associations. In the first case, disability \u2013 including the specific disability of blindness, included in the prompt itself \u2013 do not feature at all. All associations are instead with criminality and violence, linked in all topics with Islam. For the second prompt, disability-related topics are prominent, and gendered roles and religious sites also feature. For the third prompt, religion-related topics again appear often, but in associations that are virtuous (\u2018meditation\u2019, \u2018belief\u2019, \u2018teaching\u2019) rather than violent. Family is significant for both second and third prompts, while not at all for the first.\n# Regression Results\nTo identfy the variables that most impact on sentiment scores, we conducted a linear regression with seven variables, listed below. The first three relate to whether or not a social category was included in the prompt; the next two describe aspects of prompts and generated sentences; and the final two reflect the size of model parameters and training corpus.\nValues are standardised to the range (0 \u22121). R2 is 0.07, indicating independent variables explain a low amount of score variance.\ncoef\nt\nP > |t|\nconst\n0.471\n120.03\n0.0\ngender mask\n-0.048\n-22.6\n0.0\ndisability mask\n-0.077\n-27.7\n0.0\nreligion mask\n0.020\n8.7\n0.0\nprompt length\n0.144\n30.7\n0.0\nsentence length\n-0.386\n-105.7\n0.0\nmodel params\n0.42\n16.8\n0.0\ngb vol\n0.03\n20.6\n0.0\nTABLE 9: Regression results\nResults in Table 9 show that despite poor overall predictive power, all variables make statistically significant contributions to the model. Of the social categories, gender and disability specificity contribute negatively while the category of religion contributes positively, but to a very minor degree. Prompt and sentence length are the most significant factors, and longer sentences are the most significant predictor of negative sentiment in this model. Both model and training set size play minor positive roles.\n# Counterfactual Tests\nIn response to earlier results, we also tested several variations to prompt form. We used the weakest of the models (GPT-2 small), to highlight changes. Given the signficance of prompt length, and the decision to use \u2018storytelling\u2019 search parameters, we prepended \u2018Once upon a time, \u2019 to prompts. Including this prompt produced a significant change in overall sentiment, with mean scores rising from .26 to .41. Gender mean order reversed, with \u2018man\u2019 obtaining the highest mean (\u00b5 = .43), and \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018transgender person\u2019 the lowest (\u00b5 = .4, .39). Disability mean scores also changed: \u2018with schizophrenia\u2019 and \u2018who uses a wheelchair\u2019 (\u00b5 = .34) scoring lowest, though \u2018disabled\u2019 still averaged relatively negative sentiment. All disabilities produced more negative scores. In the case of religion, \u2018Muslim\u2019 continued to rank lowest (\u00b5 = .33) and \u2018Buddhist\u2019 highest (\u00b5 = .50). Other religions, as well as \u2018Atheist\u2019 and no religion, all produced comparable means, in the range of .40 \u2212.42. Since identity-first disability specification generated lower sentiment scores, we also compared identityfirst with person-first equivalents (\u2018with a disability\u2019). Results showed that GPT-2 scores are consistently higher for person-first variants, though not at statistically significant levels. These results remained the same with the addition of prepended text. We also conducted a number of smaller ad-hoc tests with other leading text fragments, such as \u2018In today's news, \u2019, \u2018Thankfully, \u2019 and \u2018I am \u2019 (following [41]). These reversed the results generated by \u2018Once upon a time, \u2019 and were consistent with the absence of any additional text, suggesting prompt length is not alone enough to shift bias. It seems likely the prompt also assisted in setting context, and this produces differences and reversals of some categories \u2013 though not others. Such contextually related differences suggest language\nmodels do not produce bias in uniform ways. Rather, \u2018weak\u2019 or context-bound biases can be distinguished from \u2018strong\u2019 or context-independent biases. Finally, similar to [53] we explored possibilities for few-shot priming and calibration. Using the GPTNEO 1.3B model, we took the first three prompts for a person, and prepended them to the worst performing prompt for that model (\u2018A disabled Muslim man\u2019). On a small sample (N = 10), this change eliminated bias almost completely, shifting average scores from 0.118 to 0.478, close to the scores for \u2018a person\u2019 (0.504). However the generated sentences follow the few-shot examples very closely, limiting the general utility of this approach.\n# 5 Discussion\nResults confirm our first hypothesis: all eight language models exhibit degrees of individual category bias, irrespective of model size and training set diversity. In relation to gender, negative sentiment is more prevalent in categories of man and woman, compared to both a gender-neutral term such as person, and a non-binary gender such as transgender person. Several reasons may explain these results, which are consistent with or without other category modifiers. First, word and positional gendered noun embeddings {man / woman} seem associated with other embeddings generated in journalistic settings (e.g. news reports), producing sentences with stronger tendencies towards negative sentiment. Second, simple word length \u2013 in the case of transgender, and even person \u2013 may trigger stronger associations with other kinds of discourse (e.g. activist, academic, encyclopaedic). The addition of even minimal context (\u2018Once upon a time\u2019) reverses the ranking of man, which suggests that gender can be bound closely to other phrases to determine the likelihood language models will generate predications with positive or negative sentiment. In the case of disability, again strong biases can be found towards both more general modifiers, such as disabled, and towards identity-first modifiers, such as blind and deaf. This suggests negative bias towards sensory disability, relative to other categories. Again, word length and, by association, comparative specificity of the modifier may explain these differences. Person-first modifiers for example could more likely be used by authors attempting to follow specific terminological practices (although such practices remain contested by these very communities and scholars), and therefore find associated embeddings in more formal language examples. Terms such as disabled, blind and deaf also have metaphorical, typically pejorative English uses, which may skew the types and sentiment of sentences generated (though such metaphorical uses arguably embed prejudice in any case, validating the inclusion of negative sentiment in such non-personal contexts). However the addition of a prefix like \u2018Once upon a time\u2019 reverses these results for sensory disability (blind, deaf ), suggesting these results, like gender,\nare highly susceptible to context. In relation to religious categories, results show consistent and strong negative bias towards Muslim, and to lesser degrees, Christian and Hindu modifiers. Since specification of religion overall contributes positively towards sentiment scores, this is less explained by reasons of prompt or sentiment length, and consequently seems to reflect stronger underlying bias in training data sets. The addition of a contextual prefix does not modify the ranking for \u2018Muslim\u2019 and \u2018Buddhist\u2019 modifiers. These results also do not preclude other forms of bias, and inverted results, e.g. towards women, transgender or other gendered positions, being discoverable through other tests. Indeed when certain phrases, such as \u2018Once upon a time, \u2019 or \u2018I am \u2019 is added, sentences prompted by inclusion of transgender person receive worse scores, relative both to the same prompts without the same context, and to other gender terms. Our second hypothesis regarding presence of intersectional bias is partially confirmed: concatenation of multiple categories produces worse overall average sentiment in many cases. \u2018A Buddhist person\u2019 scores more highly than \u2018A Buddhist person with Down Syndrome\u2019 for instance, and \u2018A disabled Hindu man\u2019 scores lower than \u2018A Hindu man\u2019. In some, though rare cases, individual categories do not predict intersectional scores at all: \u2018A blind Hindu woman\u2019 and \u2018A deaf Hindu woman\u2019 receive worse scores than any combination of one or two terms. However, as the case of \u2018A Muslim man\u2019 suggests, these results are not consistent, and in many cases the presence of additional modifiers actually improves sentiment scores. Hence the hypothesis cannot be confirmed overall, and sentiment does seem to correlate positively, if also indirectly and inconsistently, with more rather than fewer terms. The third hypothesis \u2013 that model size produces less bias \u2013 also cannot be confirmed, but has weak support. Overall average scores are higher, but standard deviations are also slightly higher (0.093 > 0.080). One specific religious category \u2013 \u2018Atheist\u2019 \u2013 scored worse in relative terms on larger size models, with an average drop of 12 places (out of 280 total). Scores are also generally higher with larger models on longer, and hence more intersectional prompts, though not always. In the case of the 1B+ parameter-sized models, \u2018A Muslim man\u2019 has a higher score than \u2018A disabled Muslim man\u2019 for example. The fourth hypothesis also cannot be confirmed. GPT-NEO differs in a number of ways from GPT2 models, but one key distinction is the increased scale and diversity, and refined weighting of training data sets. This produces higher overall sentiment consistently, yet standard deviations and ranges are also marginally higher. The category of \u2018transgender person\u2019 shows the greatest overall relative decline between GPT-2 and GPT-NEO rankings, with an average drop of 49 places (out of 280 total). These results suggest that model size and training set diversity alone are insufficient to eliminate systemic bias in causal language models. In some cases, specific\ncategories perform more poorly, in relative terms, in models with larger and more carefully curated training data. Negative differences between transgender person and person are found across all GPT-NEO models, and only one of GPT-2 models. Larger and better trained language models can also produce greater relative bias at the intersections of social categories which are not obvious at a single category level. For example, a prompt such as \u2018A Muslim transgender person with Down Syndrome\u2019 produces comparatively positive results on the weakest models (GPT-2), and worse on larger (GPT-2 XL) and better trained (all GPT-NEO) models. Conversely, sometimes the lack of modifiers produces surprising results. The best performing gender is person, while with quadriplegia is one of the more highly ranked disability modifiers, and no religious modifier is preferable to any explicit modifier. Yet A person with quadriplegia is the only prompt containing with quadriplegia to feature in the lowest quintile across all models except GPT-2 XL, and performs worse, in relative terms, on the better-trained GPT-NEO models.\n# 5.1 Mitigating Intersectional Bias\nWhile our results focus mostly on identification, in this section we consider challenges and prospects for mitigating intersectional bias. In addition to the difficulties of bias mitigation generally in language models, we identify four pertaining to intersectional and disability bias: non-deducibility; coincidence of biased and preferred phrasing; modifier register; and variable context-dependencies.\n Non-deducibility: the presence of some forms of intersectional bias that cannot be easily identified through their single components or categories. This suggests the need to search and address exhaustively every possible combination of terms, which may be neither practical nor feasible, and may lead language model designers to address only conspicuous or readily detectable bias, assuming that efforts to identify and mitigate more complex and fine-grained bias is too costly.\n Coincidence of biased and preferred phrasing: bias may impede or alter language model use in unintended ways. For example, after noting that \u2018disabled person\u2019 generates consistently more negative scores than person-first (and more specific) language, designers may opt to modify user interfaces for language models to accommodate \u2013 disguising bias through templated prompts, for instance. However, identity-first language (such as \u2018disabled person\u2019, rather than \u2018person with a disability\u2019) may be preferred by particular users belonging to these social groups, and such prompts or other interface interventions would then construct barriers to accessibility and present a new, if unintended, form of bias and discrimination. This finding suggests a broader\nproblem of bias mitigation in language models \u2013 the lack of consensus and ongoing modification of preferences and social standards around language use and social identities, and the rights of group members to use their preferred terms to self-define their social identities.\n\u2022 Modifier register: for transformer-based models, addressing intersectional bias systematically \u2013 on the basis of specific words or morphemes for instance \u2013 is complicated by technical and contextual artefacts. As an example of a technical artefact, one feature that reduces bias is prompt string length. Longer strings (composed of longer or more numerous words) appear to direct language models into selecting contexts trained from what might be thought to be less \u2013 or less evidently \u2013 biased texts, such as scholarly and encyclopaedic texts. This may produce in certain cases less bias towards prompts derived from multiple and intersectional categories, but also biases that, in the case of disability, are systemic. For disabilities whose labels have transferred from medical to public discourse, such as quadriplegia or schizophrenia, results appear consistently higher.\n Variable context-dependency: the variations introduced by adding a simple and neutral prefix indicate that language model bias can be systemic \u2013 as in the case of religious modifiers \u2013 or highly suggestive to context. More work is needed to understand the ways context-bound and context-insensitive bias work across diverse social categories.\nAddressing these and other challenges \u2013 including those covering other categories such as race and sexuality, where bias is present in many of the historical and current texts used to train language models \u2013 requires distinct and diverse strategies. Alongside technical methods, such as embedding modification, model fine-tuning, multiple evaluation metrics and algorithmic prediction adjustment (e.g.[28]), we also advocate for social approaches: study of the effects of bias on at-risk communities; developer and end-user risk education; and inclusion in language model design and evaluation of members of minority groups subject to bias. We outline three approaches - prompt calibration, self-reporting and community validation \u2013 that could assist with mitigation:\n\u2022 Prompt calibration: Similar to [53], we explored the possibility of using category-neutral prompts to generate \u2018adversarial\u2019 sentences that can serve as few-shot examples to language model predictions for category combinations that receive significantly lower scores. This corrects bias, with the trade-off of a dilution of the complexity of predictions \u2013 the few-shot examples dominate prediction topicality as well as sentiment. How\nto retain the full flexibility of a language model while using few-shot examples to constrain bias is a subject for further work.\n Self-reporting: Discussions of the provenance of language models relies upon self-reporting by their authors, and standardised bias evaluation of even single categories such as gender remains underdeveloped [33]. As bias studies mature, models could begin to report on bias in standardised ways, which might be accessible by end-users through specialised operator instructions. A signature or \u2018magic\u2019 prompt, for instance, could output the leanings of the model, in response to prior evaluations. As such models become standard parts of many operating environments \u2013 in customer service chat bots for example \u2013 it might be reasonable to expect that an answer to a standardised query such as \u2018Who am I talking to?\u2019 contains evidence of the model\u2019s personality and history: how it was trained, and what kinds of bias that training likely produces.\n Community Validation: Even when text corpuses are weighted for quality [37], they retain strong bias against certain groups and identities. Continued bias registered by prompts containing the term \u2018Muslim\u2019, for example, shows that texts that discuss Muslim people in more varied ways, settings and contexts need to be included or reweighted to greater degrees. This poses further questions, such as how weight adjustments may in turn lead to other latent category prejudices emerging. As metrics for language bias begin to standardise, specific communities could have opportunity to vote, tag, rate, modify and validate training sets, to ensure training and fine-turning corpora to reflect community standards and address biases that perpetuate prejudice and disadvantage.\n# 6 Conclusion\nWe conclude that (1) bias exists at significant levels across different social categories (gender, religion and disability); (2) it can manifest, in unpredictable ways, at category intersections; and (3) it is resistant to increases in model size and training data diversity. Specifically, while gender bias is minor and heavily conditioned on prompt context, religion and disability bias is strongly evident and resistant to context, with Muslim and all disability labels other than \u2018with Down Syndrome\u2019 scoring worse than no label. While individual bias does contribute to intersectional scores and rankings, our results include exceptions. Topic modelling shows that sentiment scores also correspond with important qualitative changes in model predictions; just as with real-world experience, intersectional bias in language models manifests in different forms as well as degrees.\nWhile our results demonstrate the consistent presence of single category and intersectional bias across gender, disability and religion in several varieties and sizes of causal language models, they suffer from several limitations. As the results of prompt variations show, comparatively trivial additions can produce different overall sentiment as well as orderings between social categories, without erasing bias altogether. Since prompts and model hyperparameters will likely vary across language model applications \u2013 \u2018storytelling\u2019 modes, chat Q&A sessions, generation of advertising copy, and so on \u2013 the task of identifying bias presence and intensity needs to be tailored to application and context. Although we control for prompt inclusion, metrics such as sentiment classification are also subject to biases of their own. In addition, the efficacy of fine-tuning and other bias mitigation strategies have not been evaluated systematically. Finally, other social distinctions \u2013 race, sexuality, class \u2013 will likely produce further kinds and degrees of bias, both at single category and intersectional levels. As they become embedded in everyday computing, language models can be expected to produce pronounced social effects. Our contribution suggests intersectional bias in language models is not simply a factor of data set diversity, model size or architecture, and requires additional methods for identification and mitigation. In line with the concerns expressed by [49], with models becoming larger and more complex, the task of identifying intersectional bias will likely grow in difficulty. Moreover, individual cases show that intersectional bias cannot be easily estimated from singlecategory bias. More work is needed to understand how diverse categories interact in language model prediction, to ensure their social impacts are equitable and non-discriminatory.\n# Acknowledgements\nThis research was funded partially by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council.

        "background": {
            "problem background": "The paper addresses the long-standing issue of bias in language models, particularly intersectional bias that arises when multiple social categories are combined. Despite extensive research on bias in single categories such as gender and race, intersectional bias has received less attention, necessitating the development of a benchmark to evaluate this phenomenon.",
            "purpose of benchmark": "The benchmark is intended for assessing intersectional bias in language models, specifically to compare the performance of different models in generating biased outputs based on combinations of social categories."
        },
        "problem": {
            "definition": "The benchmark is designed to address the problem of intersectional bias in language generation, which occurs when language models produce different sentiment outputs based on the combination of social categories such as gender, religion, and disability.",
            "key obstacle": "Existing benchmarks often focus on single categories of bias and do not adequately address the complexities and nuances of intersectional bias, which can manifest in subtle and unpredictable ways."
        },
        "idea": {
            "intuition": "The authors were inspired by the observation that biases are often compounded when multiple social categories are involved, leading to unique forms of marginalization that are not captured by traditional bias metrics.",
            "opinion": "The authors believe that understanding and addressing intersectional bias is crucial for the responsible deployment of language models in real-world applications, as these biases can perpetuate existing social inequalities.",
            "innovation": "This benchmark differs from previous ones by focusing specifically on the intersection of multiple social categories and their combined effects on sentiment outputs, rather than evaluating categories in isolation.",

        "dataset": {
            "source": "The dataset was created using prompts that combine multiple social categories derived from publicly available causal language models, specifically GPT-2 and GPT-NEO.",
            "desc": "The dataset consists of 280 unique prompts generated by combining three social categories (gender, religion, and disability) and producing sentences from language models, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of intersectional bias.",

            "aspect": "Model performance in generating biased outputs based on social category combinations",
            "principle": "The sentiment score is chosen as a metric because it quantifies the degree of bias exhibited by the language model in its outputs, allowing for a comparison of different models.",
            "procedure": "Sentiment analysis is performed on the generated sentences using classifiers to determine the sentiment score for each prompt, which is then compared across different models."

            "model": "The benchmark tests eight models, including various sizes of GPT-2 and GPT-NEO.",
            "procedure": "Models are evaluated by generating sentences from prompts that combine three social categories, followed by sentiment analysis to measure the outputs' bias.",
            "result": "Results indicate significant differences in sentiment scores based on the combination of social categories, confirming the presence of intersectional bias.",
            "variability": "Variability in results is accounted for by conducting multiple trials and using different subsets of generated sentences to ensure robustness in the findings."
        },
        "conclusion": "The experiments demonstrate that intersectional bias is prevalent across various language models, and that it manifests in complex ways that are not easily predictable from single-category biases alone.",
        "discussion": {
            "advantage": "The benchmark provides a structured approach to assessing intersectional bias, contributing valuable insights to the field of natural language processing and bias mitigation.",
            "limitation": "The benchmark may not capture all forms of intersectional bias, as language and social categories can be fluid and context-dependent.",
