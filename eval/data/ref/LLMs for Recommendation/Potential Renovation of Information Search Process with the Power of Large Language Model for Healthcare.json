AI has the capacity  to change the outcome of the healthcare field (Emdad et al., 2023). Advanced large language  models (LLMs) can highly contribute to easing the burden of clinicians, nurses, physicians, and  other health care professionals. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) integrated with AI can easily  capture sound data to convert the conversation into transcription to generate correct prescriptions (Pellecchia, 2024). Furthermore, the information generated from the LLMs with appropriate  prompts can quench the thirst of knowledge-seeking patients and clinicians. Even LLMs have  successfully passed the US MLE exam, proving the efficiency of LLMS in the medical field  (Mbakwe et al., 2023). This process of information searching and gathering can bridge a  connection between the patients and clinicians. Despite the different biases and incorrect  information provided by the LLMs, general information-seeking patients roam into LLMs to  gather their desired information. However, sometimes patients get satisfaction from the search \nresults of LLMs, sometimes patients are not satisfied. The reason for not finding appropriate  search results can be due to nonstructured prompts. However, the objective of this study is to  build a process of searching desired medical-related information search with the Information  Search Process (ISP). Therefore, this study has the following objectives: \nresults of LLMs, sometimes patients are not satisfied. The reason for not finding appropriate  search results can be due to nonstructured prompts. However, the objective of this study is to  build a process of searching desired medical-related information search with the Information  Search Process (ISP). Therefore, this study has the following objectives:  1) Development of ISP theory over the years and designing a unified ISP theory powered  AI.  2) Implementation of the proposed unified ISP theory in the healthcare field.   \n1) Development of ISP theory over the years and designing a unified ISP theory powered AI.  2) Implementation of the proposed unified ISP theory in the healthcare field.   \n# Background \nInformation systems development is focused mostly on the system\u2019s representation rather than  focusing on the users\u2019 perspective, information needs, and problems. Users\u2019 cognitive  perspectives are often missing while developing information systems. Researchers were aware o this phenomenon, they were identifying ways of understanding the information behavior of users (C. C. Kuhlthau, n.d.). Still, the impact of users\u2019 feelings was not taken into consideration by the researchers. The information Search Process (ISP) model focuses immensely on the user\u2019s  perspective and the role of affect in information-seeking behavior. The ISP model consists of six sequential major stages: task initiation, selection, exploration, focus formulation, collection, and  presentation. Six stages represent the cognitive feelings of users. This model is inspired by  Kelly\u2019s construct theory. Although, the main focus has been placed on uncertainty in ISP which  is missing in Kelly\u2019s construct theory (Kelly, 1963). Kuhlthau developed the ISP model by  conducting two series of empirical qualitative and quantitative studies over a decade on  secondary school students about library use. The summary of the output of this study indicated  identifying the uncertainty, confusion, and frustration in the thought process about the problem  statement in the early stage of the user\u2019s point of view of the ISP.  In short, the ISP model comprises of user\u2019s perspective in information seeking as a set of  thoughts, feelings, and actions. The major factor in this process is uncertainty identified in the  early stages, which converts into confidence with a clear concept of the topic over time. In this  context, the goal of ISP is not only to gather information concerning the user\u2019s information  seeking but also to use the acquired information to solve the existing problem. To accomplish  this goal, ISP consists of six stages considering information seeking from the user\u2019s perspective. The first stage of ISP is \u201cinitiation\u201d, users identify potential knowledge gaps and information  needs. In this stage, users feel uncertainty, and confusion, and realize the problem. \u201cSelection\u201d is the second stage of ISP where users identify the topic that needs to be analyzed by gathering  information. Uncertainty about the information leads to an information search. Search becomes  successful if the selections are made correctly. Actions are taken based on the selection stage.  Uncertainty increases when the selection process is delayed because of the confusion of the  topic. The next stage is \u201cExploration\u201d where the confusion and frustration of users increases  more. In this stage, users start identifying information about the topic. User uncertainty rises  because the topic is unclear. Information sources can differ along the way causing frustration  during this process. This stage is considered the most difficult stage in the ISP model. The fourth stage of this model is \u201cFormulation\u201d where uncertainty starts to decrease, and confidence \nincreases. In this stage, users identify the information required for the desired aspect of the topic The search process aligns with the assumption. Acquired insights bolster the focus and lead  toward clear-cut information on the topic. This stage makes users more confident and grows the sense of clarity among users. The fifth stage of the ISP model is the collection. In this stage,  users build a genuine interaction with information systems. Users gather information based on  the topic which increases the focus on the topic. In this phase, general information about the  topic is no longer required as the users can delve into a deeper concept of the topic. Users feel  confident as a deep sense of the topic has been gained and uncertainty diminishes. The final  stage of the ISP model is known as \u201cPresentation\u201d. In this stage, users feel satisfied if the  information search has been fruitful otherwise users feel disappointed. The user\u2019s goal always  remains that the final information can solve the existing problem or complete the task or  accomplish the goal (C. C. Kuhlthau, n.d.). Figure 1 shows the six stages of the ISP model with the change in user satisfaction. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/7009/7009fcb7-2605-4236-8e23-233f5384b93d.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Initial Model of ISP with six stages </div>\n# Development of ISP over time \nThe ISP model was developed by Kuhlthau as a part of the doctoral thesis defense. Later her research was converted into a paper in 1988. Kuhlthau conducted a longitudinal study on high school students for over 4 years from the perspective of the information search  process in libraries. This study was extended when the students went to college.  Significant changes were noticed while the results of the two studies were compared in  three areas: assignments, formulation, and procedure for information gathering (C. C.  Kuhlthau, 1988).  \n# ISP: Information seeking from the user\u2019s perspective\nKuhlthau\u2019s work expanded by adding the results of three more experiments. The third  experiment included a large scale of high school students and library users. In the fourth  experiment, high, middle, and low-grade achieving high school students were included as the  population to observe whether they have similar experiences. In the fifth study, many library  users were included to validate the results of the ISP model. In this study, the outcome presented  differences among the perspectives of the groups. Public library users seem to show more  confidence than academic library users. Interest in the topic did not increase as the search \nprogressed, rather the topic changed with the collection of new information. Users also showed a  sense of tolerance in the early stage of uncertainty. Users were responsible for showing  ownership of the process. Again, there were differences in the perception of tasks among the  users. Users started gathering information from the early stages of the search process. Users  gathered information in almost every stage while the ISP model suggests that the exploration and  formulation stage is dedicated to building user\u2019s thoughts about the topic. As a result, users  presented information about the topic without focus and clarity. The presented information on  the topic reflected the lack of perspective of the author rather it seemed to borrow a framework  from another\u2019s perspective (C. C. Kuhlthau, 1991). \n# Introduction of zones of interventions for librarians in the ISP model \nKuhlthau extended her findings of the study by introducing the zone intervention concept. This  study demonstrated the identification of zones where intervention can be made in identifying the topic. In this context of students\u2019 information search process, librarians should involve  themselves in the process of intervention. In this way, zone intervention can be helpful for the  information-seeking of students. Five zones of intervention have been identified in this study.  Zones of interventions are determined by the problems. Librarians should be aware of the  problem in four areas: task, interest, time, and availability. Students\u2019 problems and processes can determine the level of mediation. Organizers are considered the first level of mediation.  Organizers play an important role in making the collection phase self-serviced. The second level is known as the locator. The locator helps the users to identify the information sources for  specific queries of the users. The third level of mediation is the identifier which is linked with  zone three. The fourth level of mediation is known as an advisor. Advisors can identify the  patterns of search in the information sources. The fifth level of mediation is the counselor which is linked with zone five. Counselors not only identify the information sources but also address  the constructive process for learning the specific topic. There are different levels of mediators in library and university settings. The organizer is the first level, and the lecturer can be the second level of mediator related to zone two. The third level of mediator is the instructor who can  provide relevant courses for instruction. The fourth level of mediator is the tutor who can help  with strategies and course integration. The fifth level of mediator is the counselor related to zone five dealing with process instruction. Strategies of process intervention need further attention to  understand the zones of intervention. Five strategies have been identified for process  intervention: collaborating, continuing, converting, charting, and composing. Collaborating in  the information search process is very important as this is not an isolated process. Librarians can be collaborators in the intervention process. This process involves brainstorming, delegation,  networking, and integrating information. Continuing intervention deals with resolving the series  of information problems. Conversion is conducted by the counselor who guides the students by  suggesting strategies for the process. The counselor provides ways of narrowing the topic to the  students so that students do not have to delve into the broader topic. The next strategy is a  charting intervention which presents an overview of all the gathered information in a simplistic  way. The final strategy in the process intervention is composing which helps users to formulate  thoughts and develop a sense of constructive process in the information search. Counselors can  help users implement a composing strategy in the search process (C. Kuhlthau, 1994).  \n# Learning in digital libraries with the ISP approach \nThe evolution process of ISP took a new turn when the digital library concept emerged to the  surface. Kuhlthau adopted that concept into the model. Schools and libraries were adopting the  changes of the information age. Open communities were established between institutions with  the help of online computers. Educators felt the need for a new constructive approach to  learning. Constructivists took the approach of transforming existing books into digital libraries.  Teachers and librarians played a vital role in the transformation according to the constructivist  approach. Teachers and librarians made a collaborative effort in this process of creating digital  libraries. The ISP was established based on five strategies. These strategies were adaptive for  digital libraries. Creating learning environments in digital libraries was the main focus of the  researchers. Learning is the process of changing uncertainty to a clear understanding through  information seeking. The constructive process of learning consists of four phases: acting and  reflecting, feeling and formulating, predicting and choosing, and interpreting and creating.  Librarians can guide users to act and reflect on perspective before starting to read. \u201cActing and  reflecting\u201d should begin in the early stages of the ISP model. \u201cFeeling and Formulating\u201d should  be applied to the search process to have the user\u2019s view on the topic after information gathering  to remove uncertainty and understand the topic better. Librarians can help users in better  formulating. \u201cPredicting and Choosing\u201d enables users to choose the areas where users can delve  into for profound understanding through the information search process. \u201cInterpreting and  Creating\u201d enables users to create information beyond the provided information which is the main goal of the ISP model (C. C. Kuhlthau, 1997).  \n# Revisiting ISP for Coping with the Digital Age\nKuhlthau realized the problem that information environments do not remain static but change  with the use of technology. Kuhlthau conducted a study to revisit the ISP model coping with the  modern age. Digital library environment creation was an advancement in the process where it  has been integrated with the ISP model. Information retrieval also played an important role for  students and other users in the information search process. This model has been an effective way  for student\u2019s information seeking from libraries. In addition, this model provided guidance on  where to establish intervention in the search process. Diagnostic characteristics of the ISP model  have played an important role in the modern age because users have availability and access to a  huge amount of information. Students tend to focus on the final product without investigating the background knowledge. The exploration, focus, and formulation phase of the ISP model guides  the students to have thoughts in the early stages of the search process. The ISP model helps users develop a data collection framework and ways of turning information into knowledge  considering the value-added approach. The results of this study are backed up with a constructive view. Feelings can be considered as the key factor while information accumulation of certain  topics turns to clear understandable information used for solving problems. Finally, the results of  this study indicate that the ISP model still remains relevant in the age of technology (C. Kuhlthau et al., 2008). Figure 2 demonstrates an integrated view of the ISP model development over the  years. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/8910/8910c911-ab41-44eb-91db-114f687c3b3d.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: Final ISP model</div>\n# Factors Influencing ISP \nThere are a few factors that influenced the ISP model: uncertainty, confidence, user perspective, interventions, and technology. ISP model was based on the process where the user\u2019s feeling of  uncertainty turns into confidence. At the initial stages of the ISP model users possess unclear  concepts of the topic. As a result, uncertainty becomes prevalent in the initial stage of the ISP  model. As the search progresses into the final stages, the topic becomes more understandable,  and confidence increases. The user\u2019s perspective is another important factor where the user\u2019s  experience and education play a role in influencing the ISP model. Interventions in the different  stages of ISP have influenced the ISP model. Librarians and teachers have played a positive role in influencing the ISP model through intervention. Lastly, technology is the most important  factor in influencing information search. As technology is advancing, the library has turned into  a digital library, and the paper-based book has turned into digital books. ISP model has adopted  the change and encouraged to creation of digital libraries. ISP model has evolved with time to be relevant in the modern age. \n# Implementation of ISP in Different Domains\n# Children\u2019s web searching behavior using the ISP approach\nChildren\u2019s search behavior also utilizes the ISP framework in online search engines. Children\u2019s  web searching experiment included two major search engines for this purpose. Broch (2000)\u2019s  study also discussed some difficulties faced by the children during the search process.  Researchers suggested that children have an inclination towards better graphical interfaces for  searching. Usually, there is a thinking that children of modern age are tech savvy. However, the  results of the study have shown a low success rate in using the web for searching among  children. As a solution for this existing problem, teachers and librarians can work collaboratively to help children acquire internet searching skills (Broch, 2000).  \n# Exploring Collaborative Information Behavior (CIB) with ISP in th setting \nKuhlthau\u2019s study was conducted depending on individuals' experience in the information search  process while developing the ISP model. This ISP model approach was applied to find the  Collaborative Information Behavior (CIB) in a group educational setting. The social and  collaborative factor is essential for identifying user experiences, user roles, and interactions  while solving a problem. A study by Hyldeg\u00e5rd (2006) was conducted with two groups of  graduate students in library and information science. Group members initially have a weak focus, but social factors have a major impact on them. Some students in the group felt disappointed and frustrated at the end. Although, a mismatch was observed in the emotions, feelings, and  ambitions among the group members. Lack of time created an influence on the feelings of the  students and groups in the study. The results of this study suggested that sometimes uncertainty  does not turn into confidence. In this case, the negative feelings did not change into positive  feelings which was the turning point ISP model. Although, the collaborative approach helped  group members to better understand the topic and influence the feelings. Finally, social and  collaborative factors had an effect in the stages of the ISP model but feelings varied among the  individual group members (Hyldeg\u00e5rd, 2006).  \n# Information Search Process of Lawyers: A Call for \u2018JUST FOR ME\u2019 Information Services\nAnother study by Kuhlthau & Tama has presented that a user\u2019s affective experience has some  critical influence on information-seeking behavior. However, affective experience shapes the  construction of new knowledge. Previous information systems were designed to help information seeking and information collection rather than implementation to accomplish the user\u2019s goal.  Still, there is a lack of information search processes to complete a complex task. This study  focuses on information workers\u2019 perspectives on the information search process to complete their complex tasks. This study is a qualitative longitudinal study conducted with eight practicing  lawyers, four males, and four females. Participants' experience varied from six to ten years in the law farms. Data was collected in the form of semi-structured interviews. Complex tasks for the  lawyers include preparing for trial, fact gathering, and solving the problem through trial.  Formulation and constructing new thoughts require a lot of thinking for the lawyers while  completing the complex task. Lawyers have to apply different approaches to accomplish their  goals. The summary of the findings suggests that lawyers felt uncertainty at the beginning of the  search process, but uncertainty turned into confidence with the progress of the ISP model.  Although, experts responded differently to the uncertainty than novice lawyers. This result  reflects that experience plays a crucial role in information search. Lawyers mentioned that there  is a gap in generations as the materials have turned from paper-based to electronic (C. C.  Kuhlthau & Tama, 2001).  \n# ants' information needs: their role in the absorption proces\nImmigrants have specific needs for information as they travel from one place to another in search of better living and employment leaving behind the harsh reality of war, deprivation of food, and \npoverty. Another Kuhlthau\u2019s study investigated the information needs and satisfaction of  immigrants aligning with the ISP model. Data were collected through a qualitative study  including thirteen interviews with immigrant families emigrating from North America to Israel.  The findings of this study suggest that immigrants require a lot of information at the beginning  stage of the immigration process. Immigrants feel a need for critical information related to  health, schooling, housing, and banking. Although, there is a lack of information in English  regarding these essential issues. Moreover, existing information is insufficient to answer specific questions about immigrants. As a result, Immigrants remain unsatisfied after the information  search process because of the challenges of retrieving information and information scarcity.  Kuhlthau\u2019s ISP model suggests that information seeking from information search should be  conducted not only to collect and gather information but also to accomplish a task or goal (C. C.  Kuhlthau, n.d.). During this study, this purpose is not served fully (Snunith Shoham, n.d.).  \n# Proposed Unified ISP Powered with AI\nThe unified information search process leverages the capabilities of large language models  (LLMs) to streamline and enhance the efficiency of retrieving relevant information. By  integrating sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques (GuYu et al., 2021),  Kuhthau's ISP will enable a seamless interaction between users and vast data repositories. This  process will involve the LLM understanding and interpreting domain-specific user queries in a  highly nuanced manner, facilitating the extraction of precise and contextually appropriate  information across diverse datasets (Chen et al., 2020). Better prompting techniques will be  essential to conduct the interactions between the users and LLMs. The LLM model's ability to  comprehend and generate human-like text allows it to bridge gaps between varied information  sources, presenting coherent and consolidated search results. As a result, users benefit from a  more intuitive and comprehensive search experience, where the complexity of data retrieval is  significantly reduced, and the relevance of the information provided is markedly increased. This unified search mechanism not only enhances the user experience but also sets a new standard fo information accessibility in the digital age. Figure 3 provides the visualization of LLM powered ISP model. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://public-pdf-extract-kit.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/cb99/cb99a504-692d-4aa1-bcf4-86213aa6c142.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3: Proposed Unified LLM Powered ISP Model</div>\n# Implementation of ISP in Healthcare \nImplementing an information search process powered by large language models (LLMs) in  healthcare revolutionizes the way medical professionals and patients access critical data. By  harnessing the advanced natural language processing capabilities of LLMs, this system can  interpret complex medical queries and retrieve relevant information from vast and diverse  medical databases with remarkable accuracy. The process begins with the LLM understanding  the nuances of the user's question, whether it pertains to consumer health, symptoms, treatments,  drug interactions, or recent research findings (Zhang, 2012). It then navigates through extensive  healthcare records, journals, and clinical guidelines to provide precise and contextually  appropriate answers. This reduces the time healthcare providers spend searching for information, allowing them to focus more on patient care. Additionally, the system can assist patients in  understanding their conditions and treatment options, promoting informed decision-making and  better health outcomes. The integration of LLMs in healthcare search processes not only  enhances the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval but also supports a more  personalized and responsive healthcare system. \n# Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the integration of an information search process powered by large language  models (LLMs) in healthcare represents a significant advancement in medical information  retrieval and accessibility. This technology enhances the ability of healthcare professionals to  quickly and accurately access vital information, thereby improving the quality and efficiency of  patient care. Patients also benefit from more informed and personalized healthcare experiences, \nas LLMs can interpret and provide relevant information tailored to their specific needs and  queries. By reducing the time and effort required to find accurate medical information, LLMs  enable a more responsive and effective healthcare system. As this technology continues to  evolve, its potential to transform healthcare delivery and outcomes will only grow, highlighting  the critical role of advanced AI in the future of medicine. \n# References: \nReferences:\nAyinde, L., Wibowo, M.
